     * schedule_locked() (process_table, thread_table, current_thread,
     * pending_*_reap are all shared the instant more than one core exists
     * -- docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md's SMP phase).
     * spin_lock() disables THIS core's own interrupts too (the same
     * reentrancy protection Bug 10's fix relied on), so this single call
     * subsumes what used to be a hand-rolled pushfq/cli pair.
     *
     * Why interrupt-disabling is needed at all: schedule() is called from
     * two different interrupt states. From the LAPIC timer ISR, IF is
     * already 0 for the ISR's whole duration (interrupt gate), so a second
     * timer tick can't land mid-schedule() there. But schedule() is ALSO
     * called from syscall context (sys_yield, process_exit_self) — and
     * syscall_dispatch() unconditionally executes `sti` before dispatching
     * (needed so disk-I/O syscalls can wait on their completion IRQ, see
     * cpu/syscall.c). That means a schedule() call triggered by sys_exit/
     * sys_yield runs with IF=1: without spin_lock's own cli, a timer IRQ
     * could land right here — mid-scan, mid-dispatch, or between the CR3
     * switch and kernel_ctx_switch — and re-enter schedule() from the
     * timer ISR while THIS call is still mutating current_thread/
     * thread_table on the same stack (Bug 10, docs §16).
     *
     * The lock is held ACROSS the context switch inside schedule_locked(),
     * released only once execution resumes as `next` (see the
     * spin_unlock() call right after kernel_ctx_switch there) --
     * kernel_ctx_switch doesn't "return" here until THIS exact call is
     * itself the one being resumed, possibly by a different core, possibly
     * much later. Every thread that ever calls schedule()/
     * schedule_locked() follows this identical path (there is exactly one
     * call site for the "switch away" direction of kernel_ctx_switch in
     * this whole kernel), so the lock is always released exactly once per
     * switch, transferring "ownership" of the release to whichever
     * thread/core ends up resuming next -- the standard pattern for a
     * scheduler lock held across a voluntary context switch.
     *
     * IMPORTANT for callers that mark their OWN thread's state before
     * switching away (process_wait()'s BLOCKED, process_kill()'s ZOMBIE):
     * they must do that WHILE HOLDING g_sched_lock and then call
     * schedule_locked() directly, WITHOUT unlocking first. Releasing the
     * lock in between -- even briefly -- would let a different core
     * acquire it, see this thread as schedulable (READY, or ZOMBIE with
     * a hand-off already posted), and try to dispatch it while it is
     * still physically executing right here: two cores running the same
