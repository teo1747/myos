/* kernel/gfx/compositor.h -- EmbLink UI Piece 2: the window compositor.
 *
 * Piece 1 (surface.c) shares a single client surface and blits it, centred,
 * over whatever is on the framebuffer. Piece 2 turns the framebuffer into a
 * managed DESKTOP: many client "windows", each a positioned rectangle of
 * client-rendered pixels, drawn in z-order over a desktop background with
 * kernel-drawn chrome (a title bar) and a focus highlight.
 *
 * Model (deliberately simple for a first cut, documented as such):
 *   - Each window owns a kernel-side content buffer (kmalloc'd, virtually
 *     contiguous). The client PRESENTS pixels into it via copy_from_user --
 *     the same copy-on-present path sys_ui_present already uses, not the
 *     zero-copy surface-commit path (that's a future optimisation: the
 *     compositor could instead sample the client's mapped surface pages).
 *   - Compositing is REGION-based: presenting/moving a window repaints only
 *     the affected screen rectangle, redrawing every window that intersects
 *     it bottom-to-top so overlap and z-order stay correct. This mirrors the
 *     dirty-rect discipline the ring-3 toolkit already uses.
 *   - Windows are named by a small integer id, scoped to the owning pid.
 *     process teardown reclaims a crashed client's windows (memory only --
 *     the clean path is an explicit win_destroy, which also repaints). */
