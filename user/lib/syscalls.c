/* user/syscalls.c — the newlib retargeting layer for EmbLink OS.
 *
 * newlib is architecture-neutral C library code that bottoms out in a small,
 * fixed set of "system call" stubs the platform must provide; this file is
 * that set for EmbLink, each stub wrapping one of the kernel's int-0x80
 * syscalls (user/embk_syscall.h). Compiled and linked INTO a newlib program
 * (against the real <errno.h>/<sys/stat.h>/... from the cross toolchain), so
 * it uses newlib's own types and just fills them.
 *
 * NAMING: this toolchain's newlib is the REENTRANT build -- its _read_r/
 * _write_r/... wrappers call the BARE POSIX names (read, write, sbrk, ...),
 * not the _read/_write underscore forms. So the stubs here are the bare
 * names (they double as the public POSIX API), with the sole exception of
 * _exit, which is genuinely the underscore form everywhere (libc's exit()
 * flushes stdio then calls _exit()). A mismatch here shows up as an
 * "undefined reference to `read'" style LINK error, not a silent bug.
 *
 * Error convention: the kernel returns a small negative -EMBK_* code on
 * failure (values chosen to match POSIX errno, see kernel/include/errno.h),
 * so a failing stub sets `errno = -ret` and returns -1 with no translation
 * table. embk_is_err() (embk_syscall.h) draws the line at the Linux-style
 * [-4095,-1] error window, so real large results (an sbrk address, a byte
 * count) are never mistaken for error codes.
 *
 * Genuinely-absent operations (fork/execve/wait/link/unlink) fail with
 * ENOSYS rather than pretending: EmbLink's process model is spawn()-based
 * (no fork/exec), and the VFS public surface exposes no unlink/link yet.
 * Programs wanting EmbLink's native primitives (spawn, threads, handles)
 * call them directly, not through this POSIX-shaped layer. */

/* newlib's <sys/features.h> only defines _POSIX_TIMERS for targets it knows
 * (RTEMS/Cygwin), never for bare x86_64-elf, so <time.h> hides clock_gettime()
 * and the CLOCK_* ids behind `#if defined(_POSIX_TIMERS)` -- no feature-test
 * macro unlocks them. We define it ourselves because, below, we make the claim
 * TRUE: this libc does provide the POSIX monotonic/realtime clocks. Must come
 * before any libc header.
 *
 * _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK is a SECOND, separate gate: without it <time.h> still
 * hides CLOCK_MONOTONIC. (CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW/BOOTTIME sit behind __GNU_VISIBLE
 * and stay hidden -- they're GNU extensions, so the switch below serves them
 * only #ifdef'd, when something asks for GNU visibility.) */
