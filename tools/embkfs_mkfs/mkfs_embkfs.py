mkfs_embkfs.py — a minimal EMBKFS formatter (the "mkfs" for EMBKFS).

It writes a known-good EMBKFS image that the EmbLink kernel's read-only mount
path can validate against — the same role mkfs.vfat played for FAT. The image is
deliberately small but exercises the WHOLE format:

    - a primary superblock at byte 65536 (and a backup at the last block)
    - a metadata B-tree rooted at block 17: a single LEAF node (level 0) when
      the items fit in one 4 KiB block, else a level-1 internal root over as
      many leaves as the items need (build_btree auto-splits). The default boot
      image now holds enough files -- the userland ELFs, libembk.so, a real
      font -- to need multiple leaves.
    - inside the leaf/leaves, as key-sorted items:
        * the root directory's inode             {OBJID_ROOT, INODE, 0}
        * the root directory's entries           {OBJID_ROOT, DIR_ENTRY, hash}
          (one item per name hash; names that COLLIDE on the hash share one item
           as a chain of records — see build_dir_entry_items)
                * each file's inode                      {fileid, INODE, 0}
                * each file's extent                     {fileid, EXTENT, 0}
                    (length_blocks may be >1 for larger files)
        - one or more data blocks per file

The default image holds regular files plus one symlink in the root directory:
    hello.txt    — an ordinary entry (its own single-record dir-entry item)
    wgyehkb.txt  } these two share the SAME CRC32C name hash (0xC38842AB), so
    illoeuw.txt  } they land in ONE dir-entry item as a collision chain.
    hello.lnk    — a symlink object whose payload stores "hello.txt"
    plus the userland ELFs / libembk.so / font.ttf when those are built.

This still tests the superblock, node header, leaf layout, field-wise key
ordering, collision chaining, and every item type — and now, once the app set
is packed in, also the multi-leaf + internal-node descent path.

Block map (4 KiB blocks):
    block 16     : primary superblock (byte offset 65536)
    block 17     : the B-tree root (a leaf if it all fits, else a level-1 node)
    block 18..   : the remaining leaves (multi-leaf case), then file data blocks
    last block   : backup superblock

# BOUNDED and independent of file size, which is the whole point.
#
# MUST be a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE: chunks start on block boundaries, and the
# disk_block of chunk N is derived as blk + offset // BLOCK_SIZE.
#
# WHY 1 MiB, AND WHY NOT SMALLER -- this was A/B'd. Don't re-tune it from theory.
#
# Read amplification for extent size E against the kernel's read-ahead window W
# (EMBKFS_WCACHE_WIN, 64 KiB) is (2E - W)/E: a first touch verifies ALL of E but
# copies out only W, then the remaining E/W - 1 windows re-read those same blocks.
# Predicted 193.75% at E=1MiB, measured 194% -- the model is exact. It also says
# E <= W would give 100%, and E=64KiB duly measured 101%.
#
# SHIPPING 64 KiB ON THAT REASONING WOULD HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE. Same kernel,
# `test posix`, only this constant changed:
#
#                    device reads   B-tree node reads   time in dev->read

# The entire +3134 device reads is +3184 B-TREE NODE READS. ~95% of all device
# reads on that workload are tree nodes, and more extents = more items = a bigger
# tree = every COW rebuild (70 mkdirs there) reads more of it. Buying cold read

# (`ecache 48 hit / 1 miss` and `23 prefix calls` came out IDENTICAL under both,
# which is what killed the "ecache thrashes" and "prefix rescans" explanations.)
#
# So: 1 MiB. It removes the O(filesize) pathology (443% -> 194%), keeps the tree
# small, and a 2 GB file needs 2048 extents / ~98 KB of cached extent map instead
# of 32768 / ~1.5 MB. Revisit only WITH NUMBERS from `test posix` + `test ioperf`.
