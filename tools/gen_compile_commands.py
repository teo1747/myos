"""Generate compile_commands.json so clangd/clang-tidy can resolve includes.

WHY THIS EXISTS: the tree has FOUR include worlds and the Makefile hands each
its own -I set (kernel: one -Ikernel root with subtree-qualified paths; ui/: a
per-subdir -I sprawl; user/ and shell/: the SDK + newlib). clangd can't infer
any of it, because nothing here compiles per-file into a database: the kernel
is ONE gcc invocation over all of $(KERNEL_SRC), so tools like `bear` would
capture a single command, and there's no bear installed anyway. Without this,
every file opens with a wall of bogus "'include/types.h' file not found" and
the follow-on cascade ("unknown type name 'size_t'", "struct X is incomplete"),
which drowns the REAL diagnostics.

The flag sets below MIRROR the Makefile (CFLAGS / NEWLIB_CFLAGS / UIDEMO_INC /
SHELL_INC / USER_INC). They only need to be close enough for INDEXING -- this
never builds anything; the Makefile remains the single source of build truth.
If you add a new include root to the Makefile, add it here too.

Paths are emitted ABSOLUTE from wherever this runs, so the output is
machine-specific -> it is gitignored and regenerated with `make compile-commands`
rather than checked in.
