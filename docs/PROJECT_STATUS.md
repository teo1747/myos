# EmbLinkOS — Project Status & Handoff

*Last updated: 2026-07-19. Living document — reconciled from two previously
diverging copies (root `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and this file) into one canonical
version. If you're returning to this after time away, read `ARCHITECTURE.md`
first (the intended design and the decisions behind it), then this file
(what's actually built), then `TODO.md` (what's left). The repo and git
history are ground truth; this file is reconstructed for the design record —
if it disagrees with the code, the code wins.*

## Project Overview

Building a complete x86_64 operating system from absolute zero — custom
bootloader, kernel, filesystem, userspace, all hand-written with the goal of
understanding every line. No GRUB, no shortcuts. Long-term goal: run real
software, with the OS eventually self-hosting and supporting ARM64 + SMP.

EmbLinkOS today is a 64-bit x86 kernel with:
- **Bootloader**: BIOS-based 2-stage loader with hardcoded kernel layout
- **Memory**: PMM + VMM with dynamic paging (up to 4GB sustained, ~32GB architectural limit)
- **Filesystems**: EMBKFS v2 (native, transactional CoW, Merkle-checksummed, multi-volume, AES-256-XTS encryption, LZ-compression, instant snapshots, self-healing superblock, process-provenance, HMAC verified-root boot check), FAT32 (R/W), VFS multiplexer (real multi-mount, longest-prefix match)
- **Drivers**: Serial console, ATA/DMA (both IDE channels, IRQ14+IRQ15), AHCI, keyboard, VBE (EDID + mode enumeration fallback)/Bochs-DISPI/VirtIO-GPU framebuffer, ACPI/APIC, xHCI/EHCI/UHCI/OHCI USB (HID keyboard + mass storage + hub support on the legacy HCs), CMOS RTC (real wall-clock timestamps)
- **Crypto**: from-scratch SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256, PBKDF2, AES-256, AES-256-XTS (`kernel/crypto/`), every primitive checked against externally-computed known-answer vectors
- **Interrupts**: IDT + handler dispatch, exceptions, LAPIC timer (now driving preemption, per-CPU), keyboard IRQ
- **User Mode**: Ring-3 entry via iretq, ELF64 loader (static **and dynamic linking**, in-kernel — no userspace `ld.so`), ~48 int 0x80 syscalls (file I/O, process/thread management, window/compositor, IPC, memory, `sleep_ms`/`proc_alive`/`win_resize` among the newest), validated user pointers (`access_ok`/`copy_from_user`/`copy_to_user`)
- **Processes & SMP**: real `struct thread`/`struct process` split (schedulable unit vs. resource owner), multi-core bring-up (AP INIT-SIPI-SIPI, per-CPU LAPIC/GDT/TSS), a single global scheduler lock held across context switches, per-process address spaces + guarded kernel stacks + fd tables, timer-preemptive priority-band scheduler with aging, wait queues, uncatchable kill, real blocking `sys_wait`, ring-3 process AND thread handles (kernel kthreads and joinable ring-3 threads sharing one address space)
- **Userland & UI**: a newlib libc port (freestanding / static / dynamically-linked build modes), a window compositor (z-order, app-owned chrome, zero-copy windows, resizable windows, desktop widgets), and **EmUI** — a from-scratch, SwiftUI-flavored UI toolkit apps are built against, with an app-runtime layer (`EM_APPLICATION`/`EM_WIDGET`) that removes almost all boilerplate. The OS boots by default into a graphical home launcher (app grid + a live desktop clock widget), not the interactive kernel shell (see Phase 22).

## Design Philosophy

- Slow and deliberate, not fast — understand every register, bit, and SDM section.
- Build bottom-up; defer nothing that the next layer truly depends on.
- Track open issues in `TODO.md`; record completed work here.
- SMP-aware and portability-minded from the start (arch-specific code kept
  identifiable so an ARM64 port later is a contained campaign, not a rewrite).
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 for the full governing principle ("bless the clean
  native primitive; provide the compatible one as an opt-in layer") and §3 for
  the settled architectural decisions (`spawn()` over `fork()`, message ports
  over signals, capability handles for the object world) that later phases
  below build on.

## Naming & Family

- Project: **EmbLink** (Embedded + Link).
- **EmbLinkOS** — this project: general-purpose x86_64 → ARM64 OS.
- **EmbLink-RTOS** — separate sibling project: real-time OS for Cortex-M
  (own repo, own kernel; shares brand, philosophy, and copied leaf utilities,
  NOT kernel core). Future goal: the two communicate over a message protocol
  (UART now, AMP later), with EmbLinkOS providing tools for the RTOS.
- Code prefix: `embk_` for kernel-internal subsystems.
- Kernel virtual base: `0xFFFFFFFF80000000` (higher half).
- Repository: `github.com/teo1747/EmbLinkOs`.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1 — Bootloader ✅
- Custom Stage 1 (512 B, real mode, MBR signature, INT 13h).
- Custom Stage 2 (switches Real → Protected → Long Mode).
- LBA disk loading via INT 13h ext 0x42 (per-sector loop).
- E820 memory map query, A20 enable, GDT (32 + 64 bit).
- Dual page-table mapping (identity + higher half), ELF kernel loader.

### Phase 2 — IDT & Exceptions ✅
- 256-entry IDT, ISR stubs for exceptions 0–31 (NASM).
- C handler dumps register state; catches divide-by-zero, page fault, etc.
- Page-fault handler decodes CR2 + error-code bits (P/W/U/RSVD/I) per SDM 3A §4.7.

### Phase 3 — Physical Memory Manager ✅
- Bitmap allocator, dynamically sized from E820 highest address.
- Bitmap placed at kernel_end; reserves low memory, kernel, bitmap, stack.
- pmm_alloc_page() / pmm_free_page() return/accept physical addresses.

### Phase 4 — Higher-Half Kernel + VMM ✅
- Linker links the kernel at 0xFFFFFFFF80100000; far jump to higher half.
- Custom 4KB-page VMM: vmm_map / vmm_unmap / vmm_get_phys / vmm_flush_tlb.

### Phase 4.1 — Full Direct Map + MMIO mapping ✅
- Linux-style layout: direct map of all usable RAM via 2 MB huge pages.
- Separate KV2P/KP2V (kernel range) vs V2P/P2V (direct map) macros.
- vmm_map_mmio(): dynamic MMIO mapping at MMIO_BASE (4 KB pages, NOCACHE).

### Phase 5 — kprintf ✅
- Format support: %d %u %x %X %p %s %c %% with width + zero-pad, %l/%ll.
- Built on GCC __builtin va_list.
- Later refactored to share a core with snprintf (see Core Library below).

### Phase 6 — Framebuffer + Console ✅ *(superseded — see Phase 16)*
- VBE mode 0x118 (1024×768×24bpp, LFB) set in Stage 2, info passed to kernel.
- Framebuffer mapped via vmm_map_mmio; fb_put_pixel / fb_clear / fb_draw_char.
- Embedded IBM VGA 8×16 font (public domain), ASCII 0x00–0x7F.
- Console abstraction: cursor, colors, scrolling, dual backend (serial + FB).
- kprintf routes through console → appears on both serial and screen.
- *This hardcoded-VBE-only design was replaced by the GPU-abstraction +
  double-buffered framebuffer rewrite in Phase 16; kept here as the historical
  record of how the original framebuffer was built.*

### Phase 7 — Hardware Interrupts (PIC + Timer + Keyboard) ✅
- Kernel GDT (null + kernel code/data), replacing the bootloader GDT.
- 8259 PIC driver (remapped 0x20–0x2F, EOI ordering, IMR mask/unmask).
- IRQ dispatcher: 16 stubs → IDT 32–47, irq_register installs + unmasks.
- PIT timer (IRQ 0), PS/2 keyboard (IRQ 1, US QWERTY, circular buffer).

### Phase 8 — Kernel Heap + Spinlocks ✅
- Linked-list first-fit allocator (kmalloc/kfree/kcalloc/krealloc), 16-byte
  aligned, block split + bidirectional coalesce, auto-grows from PMM.
- Heap canaries + kheap_check/kheap_stats.
- spinlock_t (atomic test-and-set + IRQ save/restore); heap is IRQ-safe.
- types.h (NULL, bool, size_t).

### Phase 9 — APIC (retires 8259 PIC) ✅
- Local APIC mapped + enabled (MSR + spurious vector).
- LAPIC timer: PIT-calibrated, periodic 100 Hz, vector 48, LAPIC EOI.
- IO-APIC redirection programming; keyboard GSI 1 → vector 33 → CPU 0.
- 8259 fully masked/retired. Interrupt path: device → IO-APIC → LAPIC → CPU.
- ACPI: RSDP/RSDT/XSDT/MADT parsed (CPUs + interrupt controllers enumerated).

### Phase 10 — PCI ✅
- Legacy config access (0xCF8/0xCFC), full bus/device/function scan.
- Per-device vendor/device/class/subclass/prog_if/header type table.
- BAR parsing: read + size all 6 BARs (I/O, 32/64-bit MMIO), prefetch detect.
- io.h gained inw/outw/inl/outl.

### Phase 11 — Storage (ATA + AHCI) ✅
- **ATA PIO** (polled): multi-drive detection (primary/secondary × master/slave),
  IDENTIFY, LBA28 (CHS fallback), read/write, per-drive struct + model string.
- **ATA interrupt-driven**: IRQ 14 → vector 46; read IRQ-before-transfer, write
  poll-DRQ-then-IRQ-after, cache-flush IRQ-confirmed. IRQ count == op count.
- **ATA DMA** (bus mastering): READ DMA (0xC8) + WRITE DMA (0xCA), single-entry
  PRDT in BSS (KV2P), ≤64KB, completion via IRQ 14, zero-copy, byte-exact.
- **AHCI/SATA**: controller discovery, ABAR map, AHCI mode, port enumeration;
  command list / FIS / command-table machinery; IDENTIFY; READ DMA EXT (0x25)
  + WRITE DMA EXT (0x35), LBA48; per-port BSS memory. Verified read+write
  against host-visible ground truth on a 64 MB SATA disk.
- Original stated project goal (DMA + AHCI) reached.

### Phase 12 — Block Device Abstraction ✅
- `struct embk_block_device`: uniform interface over storage drivers via
  read/write function pointers + driver_data (the C polymorphism pattern).
- Registry with auto-naming (sda, sdb, sdc…), lookup by index or name.
- Bounds-checked embk_block_read/embk_block_write returning EMBK_* error codes.
- ATA adapter (both IDE drives, chunked to 64-sector DMA limit) and AHCI adapter
  (per-port sector count from IDENTIFY at init).
- Verified: 3 disks (2 IDE + 1 AHCI) enumerate through one interface; reads and
  writes dispatch to the correct driver with no driver-specific call-site code.
- USB mass storage joined this same registry in Phase 16 (`usb_core.c`'s
  BOT/SCSI driver registers a block device exactly like ATA/AHCI do).

### Phase 13 — FAT32 (read + write) ✅
- On-disk structures: boot sector / BPB parse, FAT mirroring, FSInfo.
- Cluster-chain traversal; directory iteration handling both 8.3 short names and
  LFN (long-file-name) entries, with LFN checksum validation.
- Read path: resolve by path, read file data across cluster chains.
- Write path: file create + write, directory-entry allocation, `mkdir`, cluster
  allocation + FAT update, FSInfo free-count maintenance.
- Oracle-validated: images verified clean by `fsck.vfat`, and files round-tripped
  against host `mcopy` (mtools) byte-for-byte.
- Mounts on the block layer; FAT32 test disk is on IDE primary slave (= sdb),
  because block-layer DMA is only wired for the IDE primary channel (see TODO).

### Phase 14 — EMBKFS read-only mount ✅
A custom copy-on-write, Merkle-checksummed filesystem with its own on-disk
format (see `EMBKFS_Specification`, plus `EMBKFS_spec_corrections.md` for the
v2.0→v2.1 fixes found during this work). The read side was built and validated
**oracle-first**: a Python formatter (`mkfs_embkfs.py`) writes known-good images
and a verifier (`verify_embkfs.py`) is the ground truth; the kernel C reader is
checked against them, never the reverse.
- **Format structs**: byte-exact, `_Static_assert`-sized (block ptr 32, key 24,
  node header 40, internal slot 56, item header 32, inode 128, extent 64,
  superblock 160).
- **CRC32C** (Castagnoli): dependency-free software port of the Python oracle;
  gate vector `crc32c("123456789") == 0xE3069283`.
- **Superblock**: read at a fixed *byte* offset (65536) to break the bootstrap
  cycle (block size itself lives in the superblock); magic + version + body
  checksum verified.
- **Node integrity, every read**: a node's own checksum over its block, AND the
  Merkle link against the parent pointer's stored checksum, plus generation and
  self-block-number. The superblock is the root of trust; the check is generic
  over leaf and internal nodes alike.
- **Field-wise key order**: keys compare as the integer tuple (object_id, type,
  offset) — not raw little-endian bytes. Strictly-increasing-key invariant
  enforced within a leaf.
- **Path resolution**: root directory inode → directory entry by CRC32C
  name-hash → authoritative byte-for-byte name compare → file inode + extent →
  read and checksum the data over its logical size.
- **Hash-collision handling**: a real same-length CRC32C collision was found
  ("wgyehkb.txt" / "illoeuw.txt", both 0xC38842AB). Colliding names share one
  directory-entry item as a chain of records (bounded by the item size, no count
  field), walked and distinguished by name; both resolve to distinct objects.
  Validated end-to-end (formatter, verifier, kernel) and kept as a regression.
- **B-tree descent**: the reader handles internal nodes (level > 0), not only a
  single root leaf. Descent picks the rightmost slot whose key is ≤ the target
  (upper-bound search, so an exact boundary key descends right), follows the
  child pointer, and recurses — node verification extending the Merkle chain to
  full tree depth. Validated on a 2-level image whose split lands a key exactly
  on a slot boundary (the ≤-not-< trap).
- Both a flat image and a 2-level tree image boot green; all files resolve with
  end-to-end data integrity verified.

#### Supporting infrastructure ✅
- **errno**: EMBK_* error codes (POSIX-aligned values) + embk_strerror().
  Convention: int + error codes for fallible ops, bool for true/false questions.
- **kstring**: kernel mini-libc (memcpy, memset, memmove, memcmp, strlen,
  strcmp, strncmp, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strchr) under standard names
  (GCC may emit implicit memcpy/memset).
- **snprintf + kprintf refactor**: both now wrap one format_string core driven
  by an output-sink callback (serial sink vs bounded-buffer sink). snprintf is
  bounds-safe and returns the would-be length (truncation detectable).

#### EMBKFS write path ✅
- **Transactional CoW**: every mutation rebuilds the affected B-tree spine
  bottom-up into fresh blocks, rewrites checksums up the Merkle chain, and
  installs an atomically swapped, generation-bumped superblock — superblock
  write is always last, in-memory state updated only on success.
- **Snapshot-aware allocator**: a per-transaction free delta; superseded nodes
  and freed data runs are reclaimed into the in-memory bitmap on commit.
- **Namespace ops**: create, mkdir (with leaf split when an item overflows a
  node), unlink, rmdir (ENOTEMPTY-guarded), rename (loop-safe across dirs),
  hard link, symlink + readlink. Directory entries are hash-keyed with
  collision chains; `.`/`..` are NOT stored on disk (resolved above the entry
  layer).
- **Object I/O**: write_object_at (sparse, allocates extents on demand),
  read_object_at, append, truncate, resize, seek (SET/CUR/END).
- **Validated** by object-I/O and namespace stress selftests (create/write/
  seek/truncate/resize/append; link/unlink/rename/symlink roundtrips;
  collision-chain shrink; leaf split/merge), all green in QEMU.

#### EMBKFS unlink-while-open safety ✅
- **Unix delete-on-last-close**: an in-memory open-reference table tracks how
  many handles hold each object alive. Free condition is `links == 0 AND
  opens == 0`; `unlink` owns on-disk `links`, the fd layer drives `opens` via
  `embkfs_object_get`/`_put`.
- **Deferred free**: `unlink` on a held-open file drops the name and sets
  `links = 0` but keeps the inode + extents; the orphan is reclaimed by the
  last `object_put`, which consults on-disk `links` as the single source of
  truth (no duplicated "unlinked" flag).
- **Crash-recovery sweep at mount**: on read-write mount, EMBKFS scans the
  live tree for inodes with `links == 0` and reclaims orphan files/symlinks,
  closing the leak window from crashes that happen between unlink and last
  close.
- **Proven**: a file stays readable through its open fd after its name is
  unlinked; blocks are reclaimed only on final close (selftest asserts the
  read-back matches the payload, so an early-free cannot pass).

#### VFS layer ✅
- **Filesystem-neutral op table** (`struct vfs_ops`): lookup, readdir, read,
  write, create, mkdir, unlink, stat, vget, obj_get/obj_put. A NULL op means
  unsupported → the VFS returns -EMBK_ENOSYS. The rest of the kernel never
  calls embkfs_* / fat32_* directly.
- **vnode = stateless value type** `{mnt, ino, type}` — owns nothing, copied
  freely; the VFS core allocates vnode storage, the fs ops only populate it.
- **Mount registry**: static table; `vfs_mount` records an already-open volume
  and wires its root vnode self-referentially (`root.mnt = &slot`). Borrows
  fs_data, never owns it. v1 = single mount at "/".
- **`vfs_resolve` is the sole path parser**: component-by-component walk via
  ->lookup; `.`/`..` handled in the path layer with a value-vnode breadcrumb
  stack (`..` bounded at root, no underflow), depth-bounded. So every fs gets
  dot-dot for free, including ones whose own walker can't.
- **Public surface**: vfs_read/write/readdir/stat (resolve-then-dispatch),
  `vfs_ls` consumer (lists any fs; sizes via vget+stat, dir size tagged as
  entry-count not bytes), boot selftest (6 checks: empty walk, `.`/`..`,
  relative rejection, ENOENT propagation, live readdir-discovered resolve).

#### File-descriptor layer ✅
- **First stateful layer above the fs**: static fd table (fds start at FD_BASE
  = 3, leaving 0/1/2 for stdio); each entry = vnode copy + cursor + flags +
  used. An fd is bound to the OBJECT, not the name → survives rename/unlink.
- **open()**: resolves once; create-on-open under O_CREAT via VFS-level
  parent/leaf split (creates the leaf only, no mkdir -p); O_EXCL → EEXIST;
  obj_get on the convergent path so create and existing-file both register the
  open. O_APPEND honored; O_TRUNC reserved (needs a truncate op).
- **close()**: obj_put BEFORE freeing the slot — this is what triggers reclaim
  of an unlinked-but-open file.
- **read/write** are cursor-driven (advance pos by bytes moved); seek SET/CUR/
  END; fstat; access-mode checks return EBADF. Selftest covers the full round
  trip plus the unlink-while-open invariant end to end through the public fd
  surface.

### Phase 15 — User Mode + Syscalls ✅
- **ELF64 Loader**: parses PT_LOAD, maps segments with correct p_flags (NX,
  W/X); loads `/init.elf` from the filesystem (multi-block extent read), not
  an embedded blob.
- **Ring-3 Entry**: iretq to user code/data, user RSP, EFLAGS=0x202,
  interrupt-live throughout user execution.
- **Context Save/Restore**: `kernel_ctx_save`/`kernel_ctx_restore` capture
  callee-saved regs + RSP + RIP + RFLAGS (software context switch — see
  Phase 17 and `docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md` §4.4 for why
  hardware task-switching is deliberately not used).
- **int 0x80 Dispatch**: syscall table with SYS_write (fd=1, serial out) +
  SYS_exit.
- **Per-process address spaces**: `vmm_create_address_space`/
  `vmm_destroy_address_space` (kernel half aliased at PML4 slots 256–511,
  user half private, freed on load failure or process exit);
  `vmm_map_in`/`vmm_get_phys_in`; late CR3 switch; higher-half `p_vaddr`
  rejected at load time.

### Phase 16 — Display Stack + Full USB Host Controller Support ✅
- **GPU abstraction** (`gpu.c`): probes PCI before `fb_init`, prefers
  VirtIO-GPU over Bochs DISPI over the plain VBE fallback (Phase 6's original
  hardcoded path).
  - **VirtIO-GPU** (`virtio_gpu.c`): full virtio 1.x modern PCI transport
    (capability-list walk, split virtqueue), 2D resource scan-out straight
    from the kernel's RAM backbuffer, presented via TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D +
    RESOURCE_FLUSH per dirty rect — the accelerated host-GPU blit path.
  - **Bochs/QEMU stdvga DISPI** (`bochs_vbe.c`): runtime modeset (no real-mode
    VBE call needed) via I/O ports 0x1CE/0x1CF, default 1024×768×32.
- **Framebuffer rewrite** (`framebuffer.c`): RAM backbuffer with dirty-rect
  `fb_present()`, clipped fill/draw rect, h/v/Bresenham lines, circles
  (outline + filled), screen-to-screen copy, fast memmove scroll, ARGB blit
  with alpha blending; console/bootanim now draw-then-present.
- **USB core** (`usb_core.c`): HCD-agnostic enumeration, data-toggle
  tracking, a HID boot-keyboard driver (with shift map), and a mass-storage
  BOT/SCSI driver that registers block devices (Phase 12's registry) — shared
  by every legacy HC.
- **UHCI** (`uhci.c`, USB 1.x, I/O BAR4), **OHCI** (`ohci.c`, USB 1.x, MMIO
  ED/TD + HCCA periodic table), **EHCI** (`ehci.c`, USB 2.0, async QH/qTD
  schedule, releases full/low-speed ports to a companion controller) — xHCI
  keeps its existing IRQ-driven path; legacy HCs are polled via `usb_poll()`
  from the main loop.
- **Fixed along the way**: `hpet_delay_us` used 1e12 instead of 1e9 fs/µs,
  making every HPET delay 1000× too long — this had silently broken LAPIC
  timer calibration (the "100 Hz" timer actually ticked every ~8.6 s).
- Verified in QEMU per-HC: HID keyboard input + mass-storage block device on
  UHCI, OHCI, EHCI (high speed), xHCI, plus an EHCI+UHCI companion handoff;
  Bochs DISPI + VirtIO-GPU modeset via screendump; VBE fallback under
  `-vga vmware`. No automated selftest yet (see `TODO.md`).

### Phase 17 — Process Lifecycle + Scheduler Bring-Up ✅
Full spec, comparative analysis against Linux/Windows/BSD/XNU, and every bug
below in much greater detail: `docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md`.
- **Mechanism**: a static `MAX_PROCESSES = 16` PCB table (`kernel/process/`),
  strict round-robin `schedule()`, `process_create()` builds a fresh address
  space + guarded kernel stack from an ELF path and fabricates a first
  context landing in `process_trampoline`, which `iretq`s to ring 3.
- **Kernel-stack guard pages**: `vmm_alloc_kernel_stack`/
  `vmm_free_kernel_stack` replace a flat `kmalloc` with page-mapped stacks
  with an unmapped guard page directly below — a kernel-mode overflow now
  faults at the overflow site instead of silently corrupting adjacent memory.
- **Zombie reclamation**: `process_reap()`, deferred one `schedule()` call
  behind the actual exit (can't free a stack still executing on) — closes
  what would otherwise be a hard ceiling of exactly `MAX_PROCESSES` process
  creations ever.
- **Three bugs found and fixed getting here** (full postmortems in the spec's
  §16 "Common Bugs"): (1) the ring-3 trampoline pushed a literal `$2` instead
  of the `%2` operand for the CS selector — null-descriptor `#GP` on every
  process start; (2) `kstack_top` was `uint16_t` in a struct storing a 64-bit
  address — silent truncation that would have corrupted `TSS.RSP0`; (3) the
  new kernel-stack VA region was placed in a PML4 slot never touched before
  boot, invisible in the first process's own page tables because
  `vmm_create_address_space()` shares the kernel half by copying PML4 entries
  *by value* at creation time, not by live reference — `#PF` cascading to
  `#DF`. Fixed by reusing `MMIO_BASE`'s already-populated PML4 slot.
- Verified end-to-end in QEMU: `/init.elf` loads from EMBKFS, runs in ring 3
  on a guarded kernel stack, prints via `sys_write`, exits via `sys_exit` —
  zero exceptions.
- **Not yet built at the time**: preemption, blocking/wait queues, priority,
  the uncatchable kernel kill (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.3 requires it day
  one), per-process fd tables, `sys_wait`/`sys_spawn`, SMP — all of these
  except priority and SMP were closed in Phase 18 below.

### Phase 18 — Scheduler Phase B, File I/O Syscalls, USB Hubs, VBE/EDID ✅
Closes nearly every gap Phase 17 left open. Full detail and postmortems:
`docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md` (§13 roadmap, §16 Common Bugs
6–9) and `TODO.md`.
- **Preemption**: `lapic_timer_handler` now calls `schedule()` every tick
  (100 Hz) — genuine timer-driven round-robin, not just syscall-triggered.
- **Wait queues**: `struct wait_queue` + intrusive `process::wait_next`;
  `wait_queue_block`/`wait_queue_wake_one`/`wait_queue_wake_all`.
- **Uncatchable kill**: `process_kill(pid)` forces `PROCESS_ZOMBIE` from any
  state (unlinking from a wait queue if blocked), redeeming
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.3's "ships with the scheduler" requirement.
- **User-pointer validation**: `cpu/usercopy.c/h` — `access_ok` (range +
  mapped-page check against the caller's own `pml4_phys`), `copy_from_user`,
  `copy_to_user`, `copy_string_from_user`. Wired into every syscall taking a
  user buffer or path.
- **File I/O + process-management syscalls**: `sys_open`/`close`/`read`/
  `lseek`/`stat`/`readdir` wired straight through to the existing VFS;
  `sys_spawn`/`sys_wait` (busy-poll based, see the spec §7.4 for why and
  what's still deferred)/`sys_yield`/`sys_getpid`. 12 syscalls total, up
  from 2.
- **Per-process fd tables**: `struct process` embeds `fds[FD_MAX_OPEN]`
  directly (fs/fd.c's `fd_table()` picks it, or a boot-time-only global
  table before any process exists) — unblocks `spawn()`'s file-action model.
- **USB hub support** (legacy HCs): `usb_core.c`'s `usb_hub_attach` walks a
  hub's ports via class-specific requests and enumerates whatever's
  connected, one level deep, depth-guarded. xHCI's hub gap is unchanged
  (separate code path) and stays documented, not silently open.
- **VBE fallback improved**: `stage2.asm` now queries EDID for the display's
  native resolution and falls back through a real BIOS mode-list
  enumeration (walking `VideoModePtr`) rather than a single hardcoded mode,
  used only when no GPU driver claims the display.
- **Automated selftests**: `test sched roundrobin`/`kill`/`reap`/
  `stackguard` (closes the gap the spec's §12 flagged), `test usb`
  (cross-checks discovered controllers against a PCI rescan), `test gpu`
  (fill_rect/get_pixel/copy_rect round-trip).
- **Four bugs found and fixed getting here** (full postmortems: the spec's
  §16, Bugs 6–9): (6) `kernel_ctx_switch`/`kernel_ctx_save` captured
  RFLAGS from inside an interrupt-gate ISR, where IF always reads 0 —
  every resumed process came back with interrupts permanently masked after
  its first preemption; fixed by forcing IF=1 in the saved snapshot
  (justified: reaching that save point at all proves IF was 1 moments
  earlier). (7) `int 0x80` is also an interrupt gate, so any syscall
  blocking on a hardware completion IRQ (disk I/O inside `sys_open`) hung
  forever; fixed with `sti` as the first instruction of
  `syscall_dispatch()`. (8) `proc_alloc()` marked a brand-new PCB
  schedulable (`PROCESS_READY`) before it was actually built, which the
  scheduler could observe and crash on the instant real preemption and a
  second concurrent `process_create()` call coexisted; fixed by having
  `proc_alloc()` mark `PROCESS_BLOCKED` instead, with `process_create()`'s
  final step the sole place that sets `READY`. (9) none of
  `process_create()`'s four early-return error paths reset `state` back to
  `PROCESS_UNUSED`, permanently leaking the PCB slot on any failed
  creation; fixed by adding the reset to all four.
- **A tenth bug, found by re-reading this same work rather than by a crash,
  closed immediately after**: `schedule()` calls made from syscall context
  (`sys_exit`/`sys_yield`) ran with IF=1 (needed for Bug 7's disk-I/O fix),
  so a timer IRQ could land mid-`schedule()` and re-enter it from the timer
  ISR while the outer call was still mutating scheduler state — a real
  reentrancy hazard, not just a Phase D/SMP hypothetical. **Fixed**:
  `schedule()` now `cli`s at entry (same `pushfq`/`cli`/conditional-`sti`
  idiom `cpu/spinlock.c` already uses) and restores the caller's original
  interrupt state on every path that doesn't go through `kernel_ctx_switch`
  (which always resumes with IF=1 anyway, per Bug 6). Verified by rerunning
  `test sched roundrobin`/`kill`/`reap`/`stackguard` in QEMU — all still
  pass, including the two that most directly exercise this exact shape
  (kthreads calling `process_exit_self`, i.e. IF=1, while being actively
  preempted). Full writeup: `docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md`
  §8(a)/Bug 10, §16.

### Phase 19 — Priority Scheduling, Real Blocking Wait, Ring-3 Handles, Interactive Shell ✅
Closes Phases C and D of the scheduler roadmap and turns the kernel's own
shell into a real process. Full detail and postmortems:
`docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md` (§4.2, §6.2/§6.3, §7.4, §16
Bugs 11–12) and `TODO.md`.
- **Priority scheduling**: 4 fixed bands (REALTIME/INTERACTIVE/NORMAL/
  BACKGROUND), round-robin within a band, aging (200ms/band — deliberately
  short; a "nicer" multi-second period would let a busy high-priority
  child visibly freeze even the kernel's own NORMAL-priority shell for
  several seconds before rescuing it). Verified via `test sched priority`.
- **Real blocking `process_wait()`/`sys_wait`**: replaces the earlier
  busy-poll. `struct process` gained `parent`/`parent_pid` (the latter
  guards against a recycled PCB slot aliasing an unrelated new process),
  `child_list`/`child_next` (live children, for `ps`), and `zombie_head`/
  `zombie_next` (a parent's exited-but-unclaimed children — deliberately
  two separate fields; one double-duty field would corrupt a sibling chain
  the moment a process tree goes more than one level deep). Verified via
  `test sched wait`.
- **Ring-3 process handles** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.4/§3.5): `sys_spawn`
  now returns a capability handle, not the raw pid; `sys_wait`/`sys_kill`
  (new) resolve a handle back to a pid via each process's own
  `handles[PROC_HANDLE_MAX]` table. Closes the confused-deputy gap a raw
  pid left open. Verified via a temporary `user/init.c` scaffold covering
  the full handle lifecycle, including invalid- and reused-handle
  rejection.
- **Interactive process control**: `main.c`'s old single-hardcoded-process
  auto-launch (`process_start_first()`, one-way) is gone; the shell now
  calls `process_adopt_current()` to become a real, permanently-scheduled
  process itself, with `run`/`ps`/`kill`/`wait`/`nice` commands. Verified
  interactively in QEMU (monitor-injected keystrokes) against a real
  `/init.elf`: spawn, list, block-and-collect a real exit code, and
  no-op-safe kill/wait on already-exited or nonexistent pids.
- **Two more bugs found and fixed getting here** (full postmortems:
  architecture doc §16, Bugs 11–12): (11) `schedule()`'s zombie hand-off
  ran *after* the "nothing else runnable" early return, which deadlocked
  the very first real use of blocking `process_wait()` (a parent sitting
  `BLOCKED`, not READY/RUNNING, with nothing else in the table) — fixed by
  reordering. (12) `struct process::parent` is a raw pointer into a
  recycled PCB slot; checking only `state != PROCESS_UNUSED` could
  misidentify an unrelated new process as the still-alive original parent
  — fixed by also snapshotting and comparing `parent_pid`.
- **Also fixed along the way**: main.c's process-launch removal (done
  before this phase) had left a stray unconditional inner `for(;;) hlt`
  that trapped the shell after at most one keystroke; removed as part of
  wiring up the real interactive loop.

### Phase 20 — SMP, Thread/Process Split, Ring-3 Threads ✅
Full spec, comparative analysis, the complete bug ledger, and every design
decision below: `docs/architecture/process-and-scheduling.md` (its own
Phase 4/5, §4.1/§6/§13/§16).
- **Per-CPU foundation** (`kernel/cpu/percpu.h/.c`): `struct cpu_data` per
  core (own TSS + RSP0/#DF stacks, `current_thread`, `pending_*_reap`,
  `online`), indexed by an APIC-ID→index table built from the MADT;
  `this_cpu()` resolves via `lapic_get_id()`. GDT split into
  `gdt_init_bsp()` (shared descriptors) + `gdt_init_this_cpu()` (per-core
  TSS descriptor + `ltr`).
- **AP bring-up** (`kernel/cpu/smp.c`, `ap_trampoline.asm`/`ap_entry.asm`):
  real-mode AP trampoline relocated below 1MB, INIT-SIPI-SIPI sequencing,
  each AP lands in `ap_main()` and becomes a real, permanently-scheduled
  idle thread — not a busy-loop stub.
- **`struct thread`/`struct process` split** (`process.h`, full rewrite):
  `thread_table[MAX_THREADS=256]` (the schedulable unit — context, kernel
  stack, state, priority, running/pinned CPU) separated from
  `process_table[MAX_PROCESSES=64]` (the resource owner — pid, address
  space, parent/child/zombie tracking, fd/handle tables).
  `current_thread` is a real per-CPU field (`cpu_table[]`); `current_process`
  is a derived, read-only `current_thread->proc` macro — every external
  consumer outside `process.c` needed either zero changes or a one-line
  NULL-check fix. `thread_create(proc, entry)` lets one process own more
  than one kernel thread, sharing its address space.
- **Single global scheduler lock** (`g_sched_lock`), held **across the
  context switch itself** — released only by whichever thread resumes on
  the far side. Per-CPU run queues are explicitly deferred (§8/§17): the
  shipped design is "one lock first, measure before sharding," not a
  speculative build. Every SMP-bring-up crash found during this phase was
  some variant of releasing this lock even one instruction too early.
- **Ring-3 threads** (Phase 5 of the arch doc): `thread_create_user()`/
  `thread_join()`/`thread_exit_self()` plus `sys_thread_create`/
  `sys_thread_join`/`sys_thread_exit` give a ring-3 process real
  multi-threading — an additional thread sharing the SAME address space,
  entering ring 3 directly, with its own dedicated (deterministically
  placed) user stack. Joinable, not auto-reaped like a kthread.
  `MAX_PROCESSES`/`MAX_THREADS` raised 16/16 → 64/256 for this (catching
  and fixing `KSTACK_SIZE`'s accidental coupling to `MAX_PROCESSES` in the
  same pass).
- **Bugs found and fixed**: 14 during SMP bring-up (two CPUs believing
  they ran the same PCB, from two different root causes; the scheduler
  lock's release-point being the load-bearing fix), zero during the
  thread/process split itself (credited to the split being designed
  around the two hazards SMP had already taught), zero new kernel bugs
  during ring-3 threads (one real test-flakiness finding in an existing
  selftest's sample size, not a kernel bug — see the arch doc §12/§13).
  Full ledger: arch doc §16.
- **Ten selftests**: `test sched roundrobin`/`kill`/`reap`/`stackguard`/
  `wait`/`priority` (pre-existing, still green under `-smp 4`),
  `test smp sched`/`kill` (cross-core dispatch + kill-while-running-
  elsewhere), `test thread smp`/`exit` (shared address space across
  threads, reaped only when the LAST thread exits), `test ring3 threads`
  (a real ring-3 process spawning/joining a second thread of itself,
  needs `make run-embkfs` for `/init.elf`).

### Phase 21 — EMBKFS v2: Compression, Encryption, Snapshots, OS-Native Features ✅
Full spec (byte-exact structs, every design decision, all known
limitations stated plainly): `docs/EMBKFS_spec_v2.2.md`, then
`docs/EMBKFS_spec_v2.3.md` for what landed after it (atomic rename, bounded
extents, the ~140x read-path rebuild). Beginner-friendly
guide also published. Plan executed in one extended pass with standing
autonomous-execution authorization; every phase has its own permanent
selftest, all green in `test embkfs all`.
- **Real timestamps**: CMOS RTC driver (`kernel/drivers/rtc.c`, from
  scratch, BCD/binary + 12/24h handling, Hinnant's `days_from_civil`);
  wired through every inode-mutating call site. Found and fixed four
  pre-existing gaps where a parent directory's own timestamps were never
  updated on create/rename/unlink/link.
- **Multi-volume mounting**: `embkfs_init()` mounts every EMBKFS
  superblock it finds (not just the first), each on its own VFS mount
  point. **Found and fixed a real, previously-invisible bug getting this
  verified**: the ATA driver only ever routed the primary IDE channel's
  interrupt (IRQ14) and always used its Bus-Master DMA registers — any
  I/O to a 3rd/4th drive (secondary channel) hung for ~2.7 hours before
  timing out (indistinguishable from a dead hang against any real
  timeout). Fixed: per-channel IRQ handling (IRQ14 + IRQ15) and per-
  channel Bus-Master register bases.
- **Crypto primitives** (`kernel/crypto/`): SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256, PBKDF2,
  AES-256, AES-256-XTS, all from scratch, all checked against externally-
  computed known-answer vectors (not just round-trip self-consistency).
- **Per-extent compression**: an LZ4-inspired (not byte-exact LZ4) codec;
  only kept when it actually shrinks block usage by at least one block.
- **AES-256-XTS encryption**: mount-time passphrase prompt (masked echo),
  PBKDF2 key derivation, LUKS-style key-check, per-block deterministic
  XTS tweak (the block's own disk address — no stored nonce needed).
  Cross-verified against an independent Python `cryptography`-based
  AES-XTS implementation, never reusing the kernel's own crypto code.
- **OS-native features** (all four, as scoped up front): self-healing
  dual-superblock repair; instant (O(1)) snapshots with a snapshot-aware
  allocator (`snap create/list/delete/rollback`) — found and fixed a real
  ordering bug where a snapshot's own creation commit could free the
  blocks its frozen root needed; process-provenance (`writer_pid` in
  every inode, `stat <path>` to view it); an HMAC-SHA256 verified-root
  boot check (kernel-embedded key — explicitly scoped as authentication,
  not real asymmetric signing, and documented as such).
- **Oracle-first discipline held throughout**: `mkfs_embkfs.py`/
  `verify_embkfs.py` updated alongside every on-disk format change,
  including independent Python ports of the compression decoder and an
  XTS decrypt path.
- **Known, deliberately-scoped limitations** (all documented in the spec,
  not hidden): snapshot allocator hold-back is conservative, not true
  per-block refcounting; rolling back to a snapshot reverts the snapshot
  registry too (newer snapshots become inaccessible); verified-root uses
  one shared kernel-embedded key; no ciphertext stealing in XTS (never
  needed, every write is block-rounded).

### Phase 22 — newlib userland, GUI stack (compositor + EmUI), dynamic linking, mouse, IPC

*Landed ahead of the "self-hosting first" ordering ARCHITECTURE.md originally
sketched — see that doc's §5/§10 for the reasoning. This phase covers
several previously-untracked pieces of work in one entry since they shipped
together and depend on each other; individually they span a mouse driver,
an in-kernel window compositor, a from-scratch UI toolkit built in five
successive versions (V1 → V5), an in-kernel dynamic linker, and a
newlib-based libc port.*

- **newlib port**: freestanding, static-newlib, and dynamically-linked build
  modes (`user/lib/crt0.c`, `syscalls.c` — the POSIX retargeting layer over
  the raw `embk_syscallN` ABI). The stock cross-toolchain's newlib lacked
  C99 printf formats (`%z`/`%ll` compiled out); fixed with a from-source
  newlib rebuild into a separate prefix (`NEWLIB_PREFIX`) rather than
  patching the toolchain in place. See `user/README.md` and
  `docs/BUILD_SETUP.md`.
- **In-kernel dynamic linker** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/syscall/elf.c`): no
  userspace `ld.so`, no `PT_INTERP` — the kernel loads an `ET_EXEC` app plus
  its one `DT_NEEDED` shared object (`libembk.so`, the UI toolkit compiled
  `-fPIC`) into the same address space at `exec`/`spawn` time, applying
  `RELATIVE`/`64`/`GLOB_DAT`/`JUMP_SLOT` relocations eagerly (no lazy PLT)
  plus `R_X86_64_COPY` for the first-ever cross-object data (not function)
  reference, which needed dedicated handling to bind back to the app's own
  copy of the symbol rather than one living in the `.so`. Two-way symbol
  resolution: the app's toolkit calls resolve into `libembk.so`; the `.so`'s
  libc calls resolve back into the app's own `--export-dynamic`'d static
  newlib (newlib itself is not PIC, so it can't live in the `.so`).
- **Mouse driver** (`kernel/drivers/input/mouse.c`) + IntelliMouse wheel
  support, feeding the compositor's pointer routing.
- **Window compositor** (`kernel/gfx/compositor.c`): z-ordered windows,
  kernel-drawn chrome (title bar + close button) or fully app-owned
  ("chromeless") chrome, zero-copy shared-memory windows (the client renders
  directly into pages mapped both into its own address space and the
  compositor's), window move/resize, click-to-focus, title-bar drag, a
  click-latch so a press landing while an app is mid-render isn't silently
  dropped (`sys_win_input` is a state poll, not an event queue), desktop
  widgets in their own z-band (always above the wallpaper, always below app
  windows), and pointer capture (drag routing sticks to the press-owner
  window even once the cursor leaves its bounds, needed for fast/steep
  drags to survive the poll rate).
- **EmUI** (`ui/`): a from-scratch, SwiftUI-flavored declarative UI toolkit,
  built in layers — a scene-graph render IR (`ui/scene`), a flexbox layout
  engine (`ui/layout`), a general reactive core (`ui/reactive`), an
  immediate-mode API over a retained instance tree with automatic
  reconciliation (`ui/declare`), a design-token theme system (`ui/theme`),
  a themed widget kit (`ui/kit`), a CPU render backend with a from-scratch
  TrueType rasterizer (`ui/backend`), and a DSL (`ui/dsl/em.{h,c}`) that
  progressed through seven iterations: V1/V2 (brace-scoped containers,
  chainable modifiers), V3 (components, navigation, charts/lists), V4
  (app-owned "chromeless" window chrome, a larger modern component set —
  Dropdown/Toast/Spinner/Gauge/SearchField/Disclosure/StatCard/EmptyState,
  tab and split-view navigation), V5 (resizable windows via a corner
  grip, always-on-desktop widgets via `EM_WIDGET`), V6 (a **menu system** —
  a `MenuBar` of drop-down `Menu`s and a right-click `ContextMenu`, both in
  the overlay layer with outside-click dismiss; right-button input is plumbed
  through the app runtime), and V7 (a focusable, scrolling, multi-line
  `TextEditor` with full caret navigation — the kernel keyboard driver gained
  extended-scancode arrow/Home/End/Delete keys, delivered as `EMBK_KEY_*`
  codes, to support it), and V8 — a **deepening pass** across three axes: the
  **layout engine** grew flex-wrap (real container wrapping), per-child
  min/max size constraints, and a true 2D `Grid`; the **render engine** grew
  sharper SDF-based rounded-rect anti-aliasing and gradient fills for text,
  icons, and borders; and the toolkit got its first **drag-and-drop** — a
  `Dock` container whose chips you drag to reorder or pull out to remove
  (`em_dock`) — which powers a **dynamic Apple-modern menu bar**
  (`user/bin/topbar.c`, auto-spawned by home): a chromeless glass strip with a
  leading logo, a `File`/`Edit`/`View` menu bar, a `DragHandle` middle that
  moves the whole bar, and a right-side dock of status chips + clock + a pin
  control that snaps the bar to a screen anchor (`em_window_move_to`). The
  backend also got a **performance pass** this
  cycle (see `EMUI_INTERNALS.md`): table-based gamma text blending (~5× on
  the text path, replacing 3 per-pixel Newton-loop `sqrtf`s) and an integer
  premultiplied source-over fast path in `draw_image`. The toolkit also gained
  its first signature **material** — frosted **glass** (`.glass = 1` / the
  `Glass()` container): the pre-existing backdrop-blur render primitive, now
  surfaced in the DSL with a translucent accent-tinted fill and an edge
  highlight, and applied to the V6 menus by default so the UI reads as layered
  rather than a flat Windows/Linux clone. Glass also went **compositor-deep**:
  an `Acrylic` window (`EMBK_WINF_GLASS`) has the kernel compositor blur the
  *desktop* behind it and composite the window over it (`fb_blur_region` +
  `fb_blit_uniform` in the framebuffer driver), so the title bar frosts the
  wallpaper and other windows show through — a real desktop-showthrough effect,
  not just an in-window blur. The desktop itself became an **aurora** — a soft
  mesh-gradient of overlapping color blobs (`aurora_build` in the compositor)
  shown through the home launcher's translucent scrim, so the acrylic windows
  now blur a colorful field and the frosted glass genuinely glows. Windows are
  also **physical objects** rather than pasted rectangles: the compositor gives
  every app window a black **drop shadow** (offset downward, deeper and wider on
  the focused window than on those behind it — depth, not colour, is the focus
  indicator) and **antialiased rounded corners**, arc, shadow and border ring
  all following the same curve (`corners_save`/`corners_carve`, which stash the
  backdrop under the four corner boxes, let every existing paint path run, then
  blend it back by 4x4-supersampled arc coverage). Windows can also be
  **minimized**: kernel-chromed windows via their title-bar button (painted
  since V4 but until now pure decoration -- it had no hit rect at all), and
  chromeless EmUI apps via the toolkit's `MinimizeButton` (syscall 90,
  `embk_win_minimize`). A parked window keeps its process running and its dock
  dot lit; clicking that dock icon calls `embk_win_restore` (syscall 89, which
  takes the SPAWN HANDLE rather than a pid, so a launcher can only bring back
  apps it started) to un-park and raise it -- which also fixed the dock click
  on an already-running app doing nothing at all. And windows **move**: opening
  grows a window in from 88% with a fade, closing collapses it to 92% and
  fades out, parking flies it down to the dock, un-parking flies it back (`compositor_anim_tick`, driven from the boot CPU's
  main loop). The motion is a scale+fade of the window's own finished pixels
  (`fb_blit_scaled_uniform`), so the app is not involved and no scene-graph
  work happens per frame -- which is why this succeeded where the earlier
  toolkit-side attempt did not. A window is also no longer PAINTED until it has
  presented a real frame, so launching an app no longer parks a black slab on
  the desktop for the seconds an app takes to render its first frame under TCG. The system **menu bar** follows the Mac
  model literally -- it spans the display, sits flush with no margin or
  rounding, is 26px, bolds the owning app's name, and carries bare status
  glyphs in equal-width slots rather than boxed chips. It paints NOTHING at all
  -- no fill, no frost: the menu bar is its text and glyphs sitting directly on
  the wallpaper. The dock names the app under the pointer in a floating glass
  label, and its band is the pill plus a gap so it reads as floating rather
  than as a taskbar welded to the screen edge; window controls are
  **traffic lights** (red close, green minimize) whose symbol appears only on
  hover, drawn as a small dot inside a deliberately larger invisible hit area.
  The three essential applications share one
  house style (`AppBar`): traffic lights leading, a centred title, the app's
  own controls trailing. **Files** is a real file manager (places sidebar,
  back/forward/up, live search that FILTERS rather than navigates, grid/list
  views, human sizes and named kinds, New Folder); **Settings** is built to the
  rule that every control changes something -- accent and light/dark apply
  instantly and persist to `/data/settings.conf`, dock size and the running
  indicator are re-read live by the desktop, and the System pane is measured
  rather than typed; the **Terminal** titles itself with the working directory.
  Preferences are one schema (`user/lib/oscfg.h`) that em_app_run applies at
  launch, so an application does not opt in to being themed -- it simply is.
  A V4.1 app-runtime
  layer (`ui/dsl/em_app.c`, `EM_APPLICATION`/`EM_WIDGET`) collapses what
  used to be ~150 lines of per-app boilerplate (font loading, arena setup,
  window creation, the event loop, dirty-rect presenting, teardown) into
  one declarative struct literal, and gates the whole event loop on
  **retained updates** — a frame is only built when there's an input edge,
  a structural change, a timer tick, or a component explicitly requests one
  (an idle app does zero UI work per poll). Every layer below the DSL has a
  host-compiled, host-run unit test (`make scene-test`/`backend-test`/
  `font-test`/`layout-test`/`reactive-test`/`declare-test`, no QEMU); whole
  screens render to PNG via `make showcase`/`showcase-v2` for a fast visual
  check before booting a VM. See `docs/EMUI_GUIDE.md` (how to build an app)
  and `docs/EMUI_INTERNALS.md` (how the toolkit itself works).
- **IPC** (`kernel/ipc/`): capability handles, channels, and endpoints for
  cross-process communication, underlying window/resource handles more
  broadly, not just a message-passing feature on its own.
- **`epfs`** (`kernel/fs/epfs.c`): an additional lightweight filesystem
  backend alongside EMBKFS/FAT32 in the VFS mount registry.
- **The home launcher** (`user/bin/home.c`) replaces the interactive kernel
  shell as the default boot target: a full-screen chromeless desktop window
  hosting an app-tile grid (click to `spawn()`), spawning the clock desktop
  widget (`clockw.elf`) automatically. It hand-rolls its own event loop
  (predates/bypasses the `EM_APPLICATION` runtime, since it owns the
  desktop layer rather than an app window) and tracks each spawned child by
  its **spawn handle** (opaque, capability-scoped — not a raw pid), which
  surfaced a real bug worth flagging for anyone spawning children from an
  EmUI app: failing to `wait()` a dead child leaks its handle out of the
  16-per-process handle table, and once that table fills, the *next* spawn
  call fails and kills the child it just created.
- **Reference apps**: `uidemo.elf`/`wmdemo.elf` (V1–V3 toolkit + compositor
  demos), `v4demo.elf` (the fullest reference — chromeless chrome, tabs,
  split view, every V4/V5 component), `v6demo.elf` (the V6 menu system — the
  "Menus" home tile), `v7demo.elf` (the V7 text editor — the "Editor" home
  tile), `clockw.elf` (the minimal `EM_WIDGET` reference, an uptime clock
  ticking on the desktop). New EmUI apps under `user/bin/*.c` are
  auto-discovered by the Makefile and packed into the EMBKFS image — no
  per-app build rule or mkfs entry to add by hand.

---

### Phase 23 — Networking: a from-scratch TCP/IP stack ✅

A whole network stack, hand-written in `kernel/net/` (split per-protocol, one

And something now STANDS on it: `httpd` (`user/httpd/` + `user/bin/httpd.c`) is a real HTTP/1.1 server that serves the OS's own filesystem -- request parsing, percent-decoded paths, directory listings, content types by extension, 403/404/405, and files streamed in 32KB bites. Point a browser on the host at a SLIRP-forwarded port and you are reading EMBKFS through our own virtio-net, IPv4, TCP and socket layer (`test httpserve`).
concern per file). virtio-net driver (mirrors the virtio-gpu transport, split
virtqueues, KV2P DMA, MSI-X RX interrupt) under Ethernet/ARP/IPv4/ICMP, then
UDP + a DHCP client (real DORA lease at boot) + a minimal DNS resolver, then
TCP: a windowed sender with Tahoe congestion control, listen/accept passive
open, RST/ICMP-unreachable for closed ports. SMP-safe (one sleeping owner-
recursive `net_lock`), event-driven RX (the recursion that made per-conn locks
deadlock is gone). Exposed to ring 3 two ways: **native CAP_NETWORK socket
handles** (a socket is a real fd) + a **BSD-sockets shim** for ports. Proof:
`test net` pings the gateway, `test dhcp`/`test dns`/`test tcp`/`test netuser`/
`test netudp` up the ladder, and **`wget` downloads a real file off the internet
to disk** (`test wget` → `HTTP 200`, HTML written to `/wget.out`, read back).

### Phase 24 — Crash resilience, the capability model, and EMBX ✅

- **Crash resilience**: a ring-3 fault kills only the faulting process
  (`process_exit_self(PROCESS_EXIT_FAULT)`), it no longer halts the machine;
  the panic path releases its lock on the recoverable branch.
- **Capabilities** (`kernel/process/capabilities.h`): coarse resource-class
  authority (cap_id == bit), seeded `EMBK_CAP_ALL` for init, **attenuated at
  spawn** (a child's set is a subset of its parent's, or `-EPERM`), the monotonic
  invariant enforced by one pure function. `sys_getcaps` (#68), a `SET_CAPS`
  spawn action, and the first real gate (a GPU surface needs `CAP_GPU`).
- **EMBX**, the OS's own executable format (`docs/EMBX_Specification_v2.md`,
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/syscall/embx.{h,c}`): a byte-exact container that carries
  what ELF cannot — a **capability table** the loader checks against the
  spawner's set (§6 step 9) before the first page is mapped, so a process is born
  holding exactly its declared caps. A dual loader (sniff the magic → EMBX or
  ELF). `test embx` loads a native `.embx` and proves the born set.

### Phase 25 — The owned toolchain, self-hosting on the metal ✅

The OS now owns and rebuilds its whole toolchain, on itself:

- **EmbCC + EmbLD** (sibling repo `EmbCC/`, adopted, not depended on): a
  from-scratch C compiler that **self-hosts on the OS** — recompiles its own 14
  sources to byte-identical objects (`test embcc self` 14/14) — and an integrated
  linker cross-built into an OS binary that relinks them into a working `embcc`
  (`test embcc selfhost`; no TCC in the loop).
- **EMBX-native output**: EmbLD emits `.embx` directly (`embld --embx --cap NAME`,
  byte-identical to the reference producer), on the host **and on the OS**
  (`test embld embx`). EmbCC compiles a program from source, EmbLD emits it as
  EMBX, the loader runs it born with its declared caps (`test embcc embx`).
- **emlibc**, the OS's own non-POSIX C library (`user/emlibc/`, see
  `docs/EMLIBC_Requirements.md`): linked *instead of* newlib (nm-proven zero
  newlib symbols) — rim (crt0/syscalls/errno) + string/stdlib/stdio (printf incl.
  `%f/%e/%g`) + a capability/handle-spawn surface (`<process.h>`) + real ~1-ulp
  **fdlibm** math (`user/emlibc/math/fdlibm/`, lifted, notice preserved).
- **Self-host, floating point included**: EmbCC compiles all of emlibc's own
  sources on the OS, EmbLD links them, and the result runs — `test emlibc
  selfhost`, and `test emlibc math selfhost` builds 39 FP units (libc + the whole
  fdlibm tree + app) on the metal and passes real math at 1e-12. **The loop is
  closed: compiler + the libc it built + linker + format + loader, one owned
  system.** (`SPAWN_ARGV_MAX` 32→64 to fit a 39-object link in one argv.)

### Phase 26 — Boot: firmware-agnostic protocol, USB/disk boot, UEFI, EmbBoot ✅

The OS now boots under **both firmwares from its own code**, off **one medium**:

- **Boot protocol** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/boot/boot_protocol.{c,h}`): one struct
  passed to the kernel in `RDI` (relayed by `kentry.asm`), replacing three
  fixed-physical-address conventions (fb `0x6000`, boot device `0x6F00`, e820
  `0x7000`). Offsets pinned by `_Static_assert`; carries the memory map, GOP/VBE
  framebuffer, boot-device id, and the ACPI RSDP. Both loaders fill the same
  struct, so one kernel runs under either firmware.
- **USB / single-disk boot** (was HDD-only): `tools/mkbootdisk.sh` builds ONE
  partitioned image — kernel in the MBR gap, EMBKFS root in partition 1 — so
  `dd usb.img → /dev/sdX` boots the whole system off a stick or disk. The kernel
  reaches it over the xHCI mass-storage block path; root **follows the boot
  device** (MBR-signature match). `make run-usb` / `run-usb-ide`. Fixed a latent
  bug: a whole disk with a partition table was probed as a bare EMBKFS and
  self-healed a bogus superblock *over the MBR* (`embk_block_is_partitioned`
  guard); stage1/2 gained INT 13h retry.
- **UEFI** (from-scratch, no GNU-EFI): a hand-written PE32+ EFI application
  (`boot/uefi/`) built with the same `x86_64-elf-gcc` (host `objcopy -O
  efi-app-x86_64` for the ELF→PE step). GOP → framebuffer, GetMemoryMap →
  `boot_mmap`, loads the kernel, builds identity + higher-half page tables,
  ExitBootServices, and jumps — reaching the **home desktop under OVMF**. ACPI
  RSDP comes from the EFI configuration table; the ATA IRQ needed an `nIEN`
  clear (OVMF hands IDE over in a polling/IRQ-disabled state). `make run-uefi` /
  `run-uefi-cow`.
- **EmbBoot** ([EMBBOOT_Design.md](EMBBOOT_Design.md)): the UEFI loader is
  growing into a menu-driven boot manager. **M1 done** — a text menu
  (`boot/uefi/menu.{c,h}` + `console.{c,h}`) with the six design entries, only
  "Boot EmbLinkOS" live; arrows/numbers/Enter + a timeout auto-boot. M2–M5
  (`.embfw` payload format, verification, Recovery/Diagnostics, Boot Manager)
  are designed, not built. BIOS boot is unaffected throughout.

### Phase 27 — Userspace v2: authority IS the namespace ✅

A ground-up rework of how userspace is entered and how authority works, on the
thesis that a process's authority *is* its namespace plus its capabilities — no
uid/gid, no `rwx`. Full design + proofs in `docs/USERSPACE_v2.md`.

- **UP1 — init as the root of authority.** The kernel now spawns exactly one user
  process, `/system/bin/init.elf` (the first user process, not the desktop), which
  brings up the desktop session and *supervises* it. The old test harness that had
  squatted the name `init.elf` became `primtest.elf`. Fonts moved off bare `/` into
  `/system/fonts`.
- **UP2 — per-process namespaces.** `kernel/fs/namespace.{c,h}` + a `struct
  namespace` on every process beside `cap_set`. Path resolution does *namespace
  lookup then walk from the bound root object* (never a global root); `/system` is a
  read-only binding, enforced (a userspace write returns EROFS before the path even
  resolves). `test namespace` 13/13; `test posix` unaffected.
- **UP2b — spawn-grant.** `SPAWN_ACTION_NS_BIND` hands a child a *narrowed*
  namespace, resolved in the parent's namespace (attenuation by construction). A
  child cannot *name* what it wasn't granted — proven live (`ns_spawn_test`).
- **UP4 — declared per-app namespaces.** An app ships `<name>.ns`; the session
  grants exactly that. The clock widget runs live confined to `ro /system`.
- **UP3 — multi-user as namespace domains.** Users are `/data/users/<name>` +
  a session profile; init is the session manager. A guest session provably cannot
  name another user's home (`mu_isolation_test`). No uid/gid anywhere.

Also **designed, not built**: the package manager + SDK (`docs/PACKAGING_AND_SDK.md`)
— packages as authority-declaring bundles, install = granting the declared authority
(kernel-enforced), a git registry + signed release binaries. And the toolchain
usage is now documented (`docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`, `EmbCC/docs/USAGE.md`).

---

### Phase 28 — TLS 1.3: a from-scratch, authenticated HTTPS stack ✅

The OS speaks **authenticated TLS 1.3** to the real internet, on crypto written
from scratch (no OpenSSL). Full design + phase log in `docs/TLS.md`; a userspace
`libtls` (`user/lib/tls/`) over the existing sockets, reusing the kernel crypto
compiled twice (three shim headers point `include/{types,kstring,kprintf}.h` at
standard headers, so `kernel/crypto/{sha256,hmac,aes}.c` run verbatim in
userspace). **15 host suites green** (`make test-tls-crypto`), every phase also
verified on the metal.

- **T1 — handshake crypto.** HKDF-SHA256, AES-128 + AES-GCM (AES generalized to
  128-bit in-kernel, `aes256_*` byte-identical), X25519 — each against RFC
  vectors. On-OS witness `test tls crypto`.
- **T2 — handshake + record layer.** The TLS 1.3 key schedule (matched
  byte-for-byte to **RFC 8448**), the record layer (per-record AEAD, nonce, AAD),
  ClientHello/ServerHello + transcript + Finished, and the client state machine
  (`tls_connect/read/write/close`). *Headline:* `test tls` did a live handshake
  with Cloudflare.
- **T3 — certificate authentication (EC).** DER/ASN.1, X.509 v3 parsing, **ECDSA
  P-256/P-384** (own Montgomery bignum + Jacobian curve math), **SHA-384/512**, a
  bundled trust store, chain building, hostname/SAN + validity, and the
  CertificateVerify check — all wired into the handshake (refuses before Finished
  on any failure). `test tls` now *authenticates* Cloudflare → **GTS Root R4**.
  **Chain constraints enforced** (RFC 5280): Basic Constraints (CA:TRUE / pathLen),
  Key Usage (keyCertSign), Extended Key Usage (serverAuth) — the classic
  leaf-as-CA forgery is refused (`test_constraints.c`). *Not yet:* Name Constraints,
  revocation (CRL/OCSP) — see `docs/TODO.md`.
- **T3.5 — RSA.** **RSA-PKCS1-v1.5** (cert-chain sigs) and **RSA-PSS** (TLS 1.3's
  RSA CertificateVerify), bignum widened to 4096-bit. `test tls rsa` authenticates
  a Let's Encrypt (all-RSA) chain → **ISRG Root X1**.
- **T4 — HTTPS client.** `wget https://` runs an authenticated fetch over libtls
  and writes the decrypted body to disk (refuses on cert failure, no insecure
  fallback). `test wget https` → `HTTP 200`, bytes on EMBKFS.
- **T5 — the package internet.** Bundled a 3rd anchor (**GlobalSign Root R3**).
  **`pkgfetch`** — a native installer using our own DEFLATE (`inflate.c`) + ZIP
  reader (`unzip.c`) — fetches a package's PyPI index + wheel over libtls and
  installs it into `/data/py/site-packages`; `test pkgfetch` installs **`six`** on
  the metal, importable in the ported Python.
- **T6 — real `pip` over our TLS.** The ported CPython's `ssl` module is a
  pure-Python shim over a native `_embtls` extension (libtls-backed), plus
  **non-blocking sockets** end-to-end (`O_NONBLOCK` fd flag, `sys_fcntl`/
  `sys_fd_poll`, non-blocking `connect`/`recv`, a `select()` in libc — witnessed by
  `test nbsock`). With those, **stock `pip install` works**: `urllib3` → our
  `ssl.py` → `_embtls` → an authenticated PyPI fetch, `pip install six` succeeds.
- **T7 — `git clone` over our TLS.** git can't fork/exec its HTTPS transport here,
  so `gitclone` (`user/git/` + `user/bin/gitclone.c`) drives git's **smart-HTTP
  protocol** directly over libtls: ref discovery, `git-upload-pack` fetch, an own
  **packfile unpacker** (own zlib-streaming inflate + delta resolution) named by an
  **own SHA-1**, then writes a real `.git` + checks out the working tree.
  `test gitclone` clones **github.com/octocat/Hello-World** into `/data/hello` on
  the metal (`GITCHECKOUT … -> OK`, README on EMBKFS); a real upstream git reads
  the result. **Delta reconstruction is proven** — a host harness matches
  `git verify-pack` byte-for-byte on both ofs- and ref-delta packs (chained), and
  `test gitclone delta` clones **octocat/Spoon-Knife** live (github's ofs-delta
  pack resolved on the metal, 3-file tree on branch `main`). **The loop closes:**
  the OS's OWN ported `git.elf` then operates on the clone — `git log` prints the
  real commit history and `git cat-file --batch-all-objects` re-hashes every
  object we wrote, both exit 0 on the metal. **Shallow clone** works too:
  `gitclone --depth N` negotiates `deepen`, writes `.git/shallow`, and the on-OS
  git reads the result as `(grafted)` — `test gitclone shallow` fetches just the
  tip (5 objects vs 10).
- **T8 — `git push` over our TLS.** The inverse: `gitpush` builds a
  blob+tree+commit, serializes them with our own **packfile writer** (`pack_write`),
  and drives **git-receive-pack** with **HTTP Basic auth** (token from the
  environment). `test gitpush` pushed a first commit **live to a real GitHub repo**
  (`GITPUSH refs/heads/main <sha> -> OK`), authenticated over our own crypto — a
  real `git clone` reads it back, `fsck` clean. **Incremental commits** work too:
  a push onto a non-empty branch fetches the tip, splices its tree (other files
  survive), and commits with the tip as parent — `test gitpush` pushes a first
  commit then an incremental one, and `main` ends with both files + a 2-commit
  chain. **The full write/negotiate frontier works too** (`test gitfeat`, live):
  **multi-ref clone** (`gitclone --ref <branch>` fetches a non-default ref),
  **nested-subtree** push (recursive tree splice for `docs/guide.md`, other files
  survive), **force-push** (`--force`, replaces history), and branch **delete**
  (`--delete`). *Deferred:* have/negotiation, side-band, thin-pack.

Trust anchors bundled: GTS Root R4 (EC P-384), ISRG Root X1 (RSA-4096), GlobalSign
Root R3 (RSA-2048), USERTrust ECC (EC P-384, for github/Sectigo) — between them,
Cloudflare/Google, Let's Encrypt, GlobalSign, and github cover a large majority of
the web. Signature schemes: ECDSA
secp256r1/secp384r1, RSA-PKCS1-v1.5, RSA-PSS. One ciphersuite:
`TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`.

**Networking reaches both libc worlds.** The kernel's CAP_NETWORK sockets
(`embk_net_*`) are now exposed through *both* userspace libcs, mirroring the
emlibc/newlib + EMBX/ELF split:
- **newlib (porting world):** a real POSIX BSD-sockets layer in `syscalls.c`
  (`socket`/`connect`/`getaddrinfo`/… — the missing `sys/socket.h`/`netdb.h`
  functions, previously ENOSYS) so ported POSIX programs (Python's `_socket`,
  git, curl) work unmodified. Witness `test sockdemo` (plain POSIX HTTP GET).
- **emlibc (native world):** a native net API (`user/emlibc/net/`, `<net.h>`) in
  EmbLink's own vocabulary — `em_tcp_connect(host,port)` returning a plain fd, no
  `sockaddr`. Witness `test emlibc net` (an HTTP GET linked against libemlibc
  only, zero newlib). This is what native EmbLink apps use.

### Phase 29 — Packaging: authority-declaring bundles (PK1) ✅

A **package** is a self-contained, authority-declaring bundle; **installing is
granting authority the kernel then enforces** — and the app physically cannot
exceed the grant. Full design in `docs/PACKAGING_AND_SDK.md`; PK1 shipped.

- **The manifest (§3)** — a human-readable `<name>.pkg` (`name/version/abi/
  build_id/caps/namespace/provides`) that *mirrors* an app's declared authority
  (its EMBX cap table + its UP4 `.ns`). It is a **view, not a second source of
  truth**: `pkg` cross-checks it against the real binary so it cannot drift.
- **`pkg`** (`user/bin/pkg.c` + `user/pkg/`): `verify` recomputes the EMBX
  `build_id` (SHA-256 with `build_id`+`header_checksum` zeroed, EMBX §3.4 — the
  kernel loader checks CRCs but not this) and matches it to the header *and* the
  manifest, cross-checks the manifest `caps:` against the cap table + `abi`.
  `install` then presents the declared authority plainly (*"…nothing else — what
  it did not declare, it cannot get"*) and adopts the bundle into
  `/data/apps/<name>/`, writing the `.ns` home enforces + a `/data/pkg/registry`
  entry. `run` spawns an installed app under EXACTLY its declared caps (SET_CAPS)
  + namespace (NS_BIND).
- **Proven** (`test pkg`, metal): a staged `pkgprobe` bundle installs; run under
  its grant it holds only `filesystem`, reaches `/system`, and **cannot name**
  `/data/users` — the confinement is kernel-enforced, not installer-promised; and
  a tampered bundle whose `build_id` fails to recompute is refused. The bundle +
  manifest are produced by `tools/embx/mkembx.py` + `tools/embx/mkpkg.py`
  (manifest derived from the EMBX → consistent by construction).
- **PK2 — the SDK generator** (`tools/embx/pkggen.py`): ONE `.pkgspec` (name,
  version, caps, grant) → all three views (the EMBX cap table, the `.ns`, the
  package manifest), **consistent by construction**. Adding `network` to the one
  spec line makes it appear in both the binary's cap table and the manifest — you
  cannot build a bundle whose declared authority disagrees with itself (§4).
  `pkgprobe`'s authority is now declared once in `user/pkg/pkgprobe.pkgspec` (was
  scattered across `mkembx`/`mkpkg` flags); `test pkg` runs green on the generated
  bundle.
- **PK3 — signing + update/rollback**. *Signing*: `tools/embx/pkgsign.py` signs
  each manifest (ECDSA P-256 over the canonical manifest); `pkg` verifies against
  the trusted key in `user/pkg/pkgkey.h` (our own `ecdsa_verify`) and refuses
  unsigned/altered/wrongly-keyed manifests — trust is in the signature, not the
  channel. *Update/rollback*: `pkg install` over an installed version retains the
  previous bundle as the rollback point and **refuses an update that widens caps
  or namespace** unless `--allow-widen` (a new version cannot silently widen its
  reach); `pkg rollback/remove/info` complete the set. `test pkg` runs 8 checks
  green on the metal.
- **PK2b — on-device package generation.** `pkgbuild` (`user/bin/pkgbuild.c` +
  `user/pkg/embxgen.c`, a C EMBX writer byte-identical to mkembx) turns one
  `.pkgspec` + a linked ELF into the three views ON THE OS ITSELF; `pkg install
  --local` adopts the unsigned dev build. `test pkgbuild` proves generate →
  install → run-confined, all on the metal — authority declared as part of
  building on the device.
- **PK4 — the git registry.** The registry is a git repo (`emblink-packages`):
  one dir per package with its signed manifest + EMBX. `test pkgregistry` clones
  it over HTTPS (our own git-over-TLS client), then `pkg install`s a package from
  the clone — the signature is verified against the trusted key **on arrival**, so
  a compromised host cannot inject a bad binary: trust is in the signature, not the
  channel. Clone → install → run-confined, all on the metal. The packaging arc is
  now complete end to end (build → sign → publish → install), and its transport is
  the very git-over-HTTPS client from Phase 28. No dependency graph, ever (the only
  "dependency" is the `abi` integer).

### Phase 30 — Vellum: the OS's own web browser (B1) ✅

The OS renders HTML it parsed itself, on a layout engine it wrote itself, in a
font engine it wrote itself. `user/web/` is split per concern behind a header
that is the contract: `html.c` parses into bounded arenas (a browser handed a
hostile page needs a bounded appetite), `style.c` computes a `struct vstyle`
from a user-agent stylesheet, `render.c` maps the CSS box model onto EmUI --
blocks become columns, an inline run becomes a wrapping row holding ONE TEXT
NODE PER WORD, list items become [marker][column] so wrapped text hangs under
itself, `<pre>` neither collapses nor wraps. `user/bin/vellum.c` is the app:
URL bar, back/forward, clickable links, a status line. The renderer reads only
`struct vstyle` and never a tag name, so real CSS changes how that struct is
FILLED and nothing else.

**JavaScript runs IN THE PAGE (B7).** QuickJS plus `user/web/jsdom.c`: a
document's own `<script>` can query the tree with the browser's CSS selector
engine, read and rewrite text, restyle elements through the cascade, and log to
the status line. One document, one world per page, an index (never a pointer)
across the boundary, and a memory budget so a stranger's loop cannot hang the
window. Clicks and timers reach the page too: `addEventListener('click')`,
`setTimeout`/`setInterval`, with the renderer making only listening elements
clickable so a page's links keep working.

**The engine half.** QuickJS 2024-01-13 cross-compiled
against newlib and hosted by ~100 lines of our own (`user/bin/js.c`) -- one
patch of two hunks for the whole 58k-line engine, both hunks merely widening
existing `#ifdef`s. `js hello.js` runs closures, regexps, Array.sort and
JSON from the OS's shell. The DOM bindings, which are the point, are next.

**Forms.** Text fields, submit buttons, GET and POST over the browser's own
network layer. Values live apart from the DOM (they are the user's, not the
document's), so a re-render never wipes a half-filled form.

**Data tables.** A `<table>` becomes one grid of the layout engine's own --
aligned columns across rows, header rows, colspan, captions -- which is what
made it a contained feature rather than a box-model rewrite.

**Pictures (B6).** PNG decodes through our own DEFLATE straight into the
compositor's premultiplied BGRA, and a small cache fetches a page's images one
at a time on the browser's worker thread -- so they appear as they arrive and
the window never stops drawing. Alt text stands in until then.

**CSS is live (B5).** `user/web/css/` implements declarations, selectors and a
real cascade -- user-agent < author < inline, specificity with document-order
tie-breaks, descendant selectors, selector lists. The seam held: it needed ONE
parser change (keep class/id/style, keep `<style>` bodies) and nothing
downstream moved.

An app now also DECLARES the capability classes it needs, in a `<name>.caps`
sidecar parsed alongside the `<name>.ns` one by `user/lib/appauth.{c,h}` -- the
capable half of "permission = nameable AND capable" (docs/USERSPACE_v2.md UP5).
Vellum is born holding exactly {filesystem, network, gpu} and nothing else: no
audio, camera, USB, raw disk, kernel extension or debug. A bug in its HTML
parser cannot reach a device that was never granted. No manifest still means
inherit, so nothing un-declared changed.

**And it is on the network (B2).** `user/web/net.c` fetches over our own TCP
and our own TLS 1.3; `user/web/url.c` decides what a location means. One entry
point, so the address bar takes a filesystem path and a URL alike. Proven on the
metal: a page served from the host over plain HTTP, a relative link resolved
against a network base, and `https://valid-isrgrootx1.letsencrypt.org/` --
a real page off the internet, authenticated to ISRG Root X1 by our own X.509
verification, rendered by our own engine
(`200  https (authenticated)  4067 bytes  62 nodes`). Two toolkit bugs and one layout-engine bug
were found by building it, all fixed and locked by host tests; a wrap row is
now exempt from flex-shrink, and a row measures a wrapping child at the width
it will get.

**`make browser-render`** runs the entire pipeline -- parse, style, render,
layout, geometry dump, PNG -- on the dev host in two seconds, because nothing
between document bytes and pixel rectangles needs a syscall. It is the fast
loop for anything in this stack.

**And it shows photographs (JPEG).** `user/web/jpeg.c` is a from-scratch
baseline JPEG decoder -- canonical Huffman rebuilt from code lengths, a
fixed-point inverse DCT, chroma upsampling and the YCbCr conversion. Which
decoder runs is chosen by the file's SIGNATURE, not its extension. Progressive
is refused rather than half-decoded. Fifteen host assertions pin it against real
encoder output, including every truncation of a valid file.

**And you can take text out of it.** Drag to select, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C to the
system clipboard -- proven on the metal by copying from Vellum and pasting into
the shell with Ctrl+V. `user/web/select.c` works entirely after layout: it reads
the laid-out scene for where the words are and writes a background onto the
selected ones, so render.c does not participate. Word granularity (the renderer
already emits one node per word); the limits are in TODO.md.

**The raster is ~25x cheaper, and the number came from measuring rather than
guessing.** A page with a photograph took 21 seconds to appear; the float IDCT
was the obvious suspect and was the wrong one. Instrumenting said the fetch took
6ms, the decode 96ms, and the image then sat finished for 4.7 SECONDS waiting
for a frame -- because `cpu_draw_rect` had no early-out for a fill that paints
nothing, and a document emits a transparent background for every block element.
Each one walked its whole box through a rounded-box SDF and a float blend to
write nothing. Frame render went 4946ms -> 170-483ms and scrolling ~4s ->
0.74s. Landed with `box_fully_covered()`, which answers "is coverage trivially
1?" once per primitive instead of once per pixel, and a fixed-point stepper in
the image blit. Every EmUI surface benefits, not just the browser.

**It holds more than one page, and it zooms.** `user/web/tabs.c` is the tab
model: a tab keeps its URL, title, scroll position, zoom and its own
back/forward stack, plus the SOURCE BYTES it was built from. It does not keep a
parsed document -- that arena is bounded at 8192 nodes precisely because a page
can be hostile, and six of those is six times a bound chosen to be safe. So
switching re-parses from the retained bytes: no network, no re-POST, and no
chance of getting a different page than the one you left. The honest cost,
stated in `tabs.h` rather than discovered later, is that a background tab's
scripts stop and its DOM is rebuilt on return.

Zoom is PAGE zoom, not UI zoom: `em_set_text_scale` is a bracket the browser
opens around the document it emits, so the text and the author's stated lengths
scale while the address bar does not. Bound to `+` / `-` / `0` as bare keys --
not `Ctrl+=`, because the keyboard driver passes Ctrl+symbol through unchanged
and binding a chord it cannot distinguish would be a lie about what was pressed.
The corpus pins it by rendering one page at two zooms and comparing (`EXPECT-ZOOM`);
a single render could say nothing about a scale factor.

**A toolkit bug the browser made visible.** EmUI matched a container's children
to last frame's by POSITION, so inserting a row displaced every sibling below
it -- each adopting its neighbour's retained instance, and with it whatever size
nobody restated that frame. The browser's find bar had been drawing over its
address bar for this reason. `EmProps.key` gives a container a reconciliation
identity, and the rule is to key the rows that STAY, not just the one that comes
and goes: it is the stable rows that get displaced. `declare-test` T5b pins both
halves, including an unkeyed control that demonstrates the displacement
(`48 30 12 0` for rows declared `48 20 30 12`) -- an earlier version of that test
restated every size each frame and passed while the browser was visibly broken.

**Pointed at the real web, it broke in five places -- so those are fixed.**
Everything before this had been verified against pages written by the same
person who wrote the engine, which can only confirm what was already
understood. Rendering seventeen real sites (with their stylesheets) found, in
order of severity: a SEGFAULT on Wikipedia, where the reconciler's cursor stack
overflowed on a deep tree and every refused push was still matched by a pop
until the top walked off the bottom into a null dereference; pseudo-element
selectors matching the element they hang off, so the clearfix
`.container:after { display: table }` styled the container and python.org
rendered zero words; `display: table` on anything without rows dropping its
whole subtree; selectors longer than the parser holds keeping their FIRST
compounds instead of their last, so a rule was applied to an ancestor of its
target -- with `display:none` on the end of it, that deletes a page; and a
cascade whose match list was an `unsigned char` array, exactly wide enough at
256 rules and silent corruption above it.

That last one only appeared because the rule cap was raised -- from 256 to
4096, a number that came from counting: the median real page needs 132 rules,
but bbc wants 781, mdn 1020, rust-lang 2570 and python.org 4314, and a page
styled by an arbitrary first 256 of its rules is styled arbitrarily. The
harness grew a `HIDDEN=1` mode that reports which elements the cascade turned
off and which rule did it, because "the page is blank" should be a lookup
rather than an evening of bisecting a stylesheet.

All seventeen now render, and then the run's other finding -- that a frame cost
315ms on Wikipedia -- turned out to be three separate costs, only one of them
the obvious one. Rules are now filed in a SELECTOR INDEX under their subject's
most selective name, so an element tests only the rules that could match it.
The reconciler no longer unlinks every child every frame: relink walked the
parent's child list to find each child's predecessor, which is quadratic in
siblings, and a page that is one long list is most pages worth reading. And
computed style is memoised per pass, because the renderer asks for the same
element's style from sixteen places and was running the whole cascade each
time. Per pass on the host: Wikipedia 315 -> 88ms, bbc 194 -> 24, python.org
104 -> 12, rust-lang 56 -> 2.4.

The reconciler fixes are EmUI-wide, not browser-only -- every app builds its
tree through the same relink.

What is left is in `TODO.md` under its own heading.

**Then the pages were LOOKED at, and that found five more.** Every check up to
this point counted text runs, which says a word reached the screen and nothing
about where it landed -- so the first real page rendered to an image came out
as a column of centred headlines with its rank numbers stranded at the left,
having passed everything. A table was inheriting text-align, so <center> around
a layout table -- how half the old web is built -- centred every cell instead of
centring the table. Link words carried 2px of padding a side, setting linked
text looser than the text beside it. Removing that padding then exposed what it
had been hiding: a whitespace-only text node between two inline elements was
being dropped entirely, so "tosh 7 hours ago" read "tosh7 hours ago" -- one bug
concealing another, with the page looking wrong-but-plausible throughout. The
space is now owed to the following word, which is also what makes it collapse
at the start of a line the way CSS says it must. And bgcolor/align/color are
mapped to the CSS they are defined to mean, so the old web's colours arrive:
Hacker News paints its header with an attribute, not a stylesheet.

One of these was an API defect rather than a browser one. EmProps uses 0 to
mean "unset, take the theme's value", which left no way to ask for zero -- so
`.px(0)` on a link word silently got 16px. `EmZero` says it explicitly.

**And then the pages were drawn with the wrong palette, which looking found
too.** A document is written against a white canvas with dark text -- that is
not a preference, it is the initial value every page on the web assumes, and it
is why a page can set a background and say nothing about colour. Drawing it on
the desktop's dark surface with the desktop's light text produced Wikipedia as
pale headings on the white background the page itself had set: our foreground
over their background, readable in neither direction. The document now keeps a
browser's palette (white canvas, near-black ink, the web's blue) and the
chrome keeps the desktop's -- which is what a desktop browser does in dark
mode, and the reason a page looks the same there as anywhere else.

**The corpus now compares each page against a stored reference image**
(`tests/web/refs`, 420KB gzipped; `make web-corpus BLESS=1` to regenerate).
Every expectation before this was about words and where they are, and none of
them caught any of the six defects that looking found -- each changed how a
page LOOKED without changing which words existed or their order. The new check
catches a one-pixel padding change on three pages. `make web-real` fetches
seventeen real sites with their stylesheets and renders them; `SHOTS=1` writes
a PNG of each, because "did it produce text" and "does it look right" are
different questions and only the second one needed asking.

## Major To-Do Buckets (Rough Priority)

Full detail lives in `TODO.md`, organized by subsystem. Rough priority order:

### High Priority (block real programs)
1. ~~User-pointer validation~~ — ✅ done, Phase 18.
2. ~~Process & Scheduling gaps (preemption, blocking, uncatchable kill,
   per-process fd tables)~~ — ✅ done, Phase 18. Priority scheduling and
   real blocking wait also now done, Phase 19. SMP + the thread/process
   split + ring-3 threads also now done, Phase 20.
3. ~~File I/O syscalls~~ — ✅ done, Phase 18.
4. ~~A real blocking `sys_wait`~~ — ✅ done, Phase 19: `process::parent`/
   `parent_pid`/`zombie_head`/`zombie_next`/`child_wait` tracking, no more
   busy-polling. Found and fixed a real deadlock getting this exercised
   for the first time (Bug 11).
5. ~~The syscall-context `schedule()` reentrancy gap~~ — ✅ done, Phase 18
   (Bug 10 above).
6. ~~Ring-3 process handles for spawn/wait/kill~~ — ✅ done, Phase 19: closes
   the confused-deputy gap a raw pid argument left open.
7. ~~SMP~~ — ✅ done, Phase 20: real multi-core bring-up, per-CPU
   `current_thread`, one global scheduler lock held across context
   switches. Per-CPU run queues specifically remain deferred (see Lower
   Priority below) until the global lock is measured to bottleneck.

### Medium Priority (real-world use)
1. **Filesystems**: ~~EMBKFS crash-safe orphan reclaim~~ (mount-time sweep
   done; on-disk orphan list for the crash-safety tier still open), ~~VFS
   multi-mount~~ (done, Phase 21), `.truncate`/`.readlink` ops still open;
   FAT32 IDE secondary channel note is now moot (both channels work, see
   Phase 21). EMBKFS v2 (Phase 21) shipped compression/encryption/
   snapshots/self-heal/provenance/verified-boot — see `TODO.md`'s new
   EMBKFS v2 subsection for that work's own follow-ups (snapshot
   refcounting, asymmetric verified-root signing).
2. **Drivers**: keyboard modifiers/extended scancodes, `vmm_map_mmio_wc`
   (write-combining), USB isochronous transfers, xHCI hub support (legacy
   HCs got hub support in Phase 18; xHCI's is a separate code path, still
   open), USB hot-plug.
3. **Synchronization**: per-CPU heap caches, locks around currently-unlocked
   global tables (per-process fd tables, EMBKFS open-ref table) — SMP now
   exists (Phase 20) but nothing currently races these specific tables
   from more than one core concurrently; revisit before that changes. The
   process/thread tables themselves are already locked (`g_sched_lock`,
   Phase 20).

### Lower Priority (architecture)
1. **Per-CPU run queues**: the one piece of the SMP work deliberately left
   unbuilt — see Phase 20 above and the arch doc §8/§17 for why (measure
   the global lock first, don't shard speculatively).
2. **Syscall fast-path**: STAR/LSTAR/SFMASK for `syscall`/`sysret`.
3. **Bootloader v2**: ~~UEFI support~~ ✅ (from-scratch loader) and ~~USB boot~~ ✅
   (one partitioned medium) are DONE — see Phase 26. Still open: ELF-aware BIOS
   loading (stage2 loads a fixed sector count), CD/El Torito, and EmbBoot M2–M5.
4. **Slab allocator**: fixed-size pools on top of the heap (currently
   linked-list first-fit only).

## Known Limits & Caveats

Full list, kept current: `TODO.md`. Summary of the ones most likely to bite:

### Memory
- Bitmap-based PMM is O(n); page tables constrained such that RAM has a
  ~32 GB architectural ceiling today (see `TODO.md`'s VMM section for the
  exact mechanism and the two-phase-paging-bootstrap fix).
- Kernel stack region and heap live in fixed VA ranges chosen to share
  already-populated PML4 slots at process-creation time — see Phase 17's
  Bug 3 above and the spec's §7.2 before adding another such region.

### Filesystems
- No crash-safe orphan reclaim beyond the mount-time sweep (EMBKFS); no
  symlink resolution in the VFS yet (EMBKFS itself supports it).
- VFS now supports real multi-mount (longest-prefix match, `vfs_find_mount`,
  up to `VFS_MAX_MOUNTS = 8`) — landed alongside EMBKFS v2's multi-volume
  mounting (Phase 21). No `.readlink`/`.truncate` ops yet (see `TODO.md`).
- EMBKFS v2 (Phase 21) known, deliberately-scoped limitations — all
  documented in `docs/EMBKFS_spec_v2.2.md`, not hidden: snapshot allocator
  hold-back is conservative (not true per-block refcounting); rolling
  back to a snapshot reverts its own registry entry too (newer snapshots
  become inaccessible after an older rollback); verified-root boot check
  uses one kernel-embedded HMAC key, not real asymmetric signing; no XTS
  ciphertext stealing (never needed — every write is block-rounded).

### Drivers
- VBE now does EDID + BIOS mode-list enumeration instead of one hardcoded
  mode — only reached when no GPU driver claims the display (Phase 16
  covers the common case) — but the fallback-of-fallbacks (no VBE at all,
  text mode at 0xB8000) is unchanged and still hangs at `.vbe_failed`.
- USB: hub support on UHCI/OHCI/EHCI (Phase 18); xHCI hub support and
  isochronous transfers on any controller are still open.
- Keyboard: ASCII-only, no modifiers/extended scancodes.
- ATA: both IDE channels now fully interrupt-driven and DMA-capable
  (Phase 21 fixed the secondary channel — see Phase 21 above); AHCI is
  still port-0-only.

### User Mode / Process
- User pointers are now validated (`access_ok`/`copy_from_user`/
  `copy_to_user`, Phase 18).
- 16 syscalls exist (write, exit, yield, open, close, read, lseek, stat,
  readdir, spawn, wait, getpid, kill, thread_create, thread_join,
  thread_exit) — `sys_spawn`/`sys_wait`/`sys_kill` take/return capability
  handles (Phase 19), not raw pids.
- Preemption, wait queues, the uncatchable kill, priority scheduling
  (4 bands + aging), real blocking `process_wait()`/`sys_wait`, SMP
  (multi-core bring-up, a real per-CPU `current_thread`, one global
  scheduler lock held across context switches), the `struct thread`/
  `struct process` split, and joinable ring-3 threads are all built
  (Phases 18–20). `schedule()` is reentrancy-safe against the timer ISR
  regardless of which context it's called from, and its zombie hand-off
  no longer deadlocks a blocked waiter. Still open: per-CPU run queues
  (§6.3/§8 of the arch doc) — deliberately deferred until the single
  global scheduler lock is *measured* to bottleneck, not built ahead of
  need.

## Test Status

| Subsystem | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PMM | ✅ Passes | Allocates/frees pages consistently |
| VMM | ✅ Passes | Maps kernel + user, NX works |
| EMBKFS v2 | ✅ Passes | `test embkfs all` — create/read/write/unlink/mkdir/rename/link/symlink, collision-chain and B-tree-descent regressions, RTC timestamps, multi-volume mount, LZ compression, self-heal, snapshots, process-provenance, HMAC verified-root boot check. `test crypto all` — SHA-256/HMAC/PBKDF2/AES-256/XTS against known-answer vectors. Independent oracle: `verify_embkfs.py` (incl. `--passphrase` for encrypted images) |
| FAT32 | ✅ Passes | Read/write long filenames on MBR partition, oracle-validated against `fsck.vfat`/`mcopy` |
| VFS | ✅ Passes | Path resolution, real multi-mount (longest-prefix), multi-FS discovery, `ls`, boot selftest (6 checks) |
| File descriptors | ✅ Passes | open/close/read/write/seek/fstat, create-on-open, unlink-while-open, selftest |
| ATA | ✅ Passes | DMA+IRQ on BOTH IDE channels (Phase 21 fixed the secondary channel), MBR partition discovery |
| AHCI | ✅ Passes | Read/write on port 0 (polling), verified against host ground truth |
| Ring-3 Entry | ✅ Passes | ELF loads, user code runs, iretq works, syscalls dispatch |
| SMP / Threads | ✅ Passes | `test smp sched`/`kill`, `test thread smp`/`exit`, `test ring3 threads` (Phase 20) — cross-core dispatch, shared-address-space threading, joinable ring-3 threads, all under `-smp 4` |
| LAPIC Timer | ✅ Passes | 100 Hz ticks, TSC calibrated |
| rwlock | ✅ Passes | Reader/writer locking, smoke test passes |
| GPU / Framebuffer | ✅ Passes | `test gpu` (`fb_run_selftests`): fill_rect/get_pixel/copy_rect round-trip, exact colors, boundary non-bleed. Plus manual: Bochs DISPI + VirtIO-GPU modeset verified via QEMU screendump; VBE EDID/enumeration fallback verified (selects a genuinely different mode than the old hardcoded one under `-vga cirrus`). |
| USB (UHCI/OHCI/EHCI/xHCI) | ✅ Passes | `test usb` (`usb_run_selftests`): cross-checks discovered controllers against a fresh PCI rescan. Plus manual: HID keyboard input + mass-storage block device verified per-HC in QEMU, an EHCI+UHCI companion handoff, and a keyboard behind a `usb-hub` on UHCI (hub support, Phase 18). |
| Process lifecycle / scheduler | ✅ Passes | `test sched roundrobin`/`kill`/`reap`/`stackguard`/`wait`/`priority` (`process_test_*`, Phase 18/19) — six selftests, all green. Plus manual: `/init.elf` loads, runs in ring 3 on a guarded kernel stack, exits cleanly, zero exceptions; real preemption verified interleaving two kthreads; the full ring-3 handle lifecycle (`sys_spawn`/`sys_wait`/invalid/reused-handle rejection) verified end to end; the interactive shell's `run`/`ps`/`kill`/`wait`/`nice` commands verified end to end in QEMU via monitor-injected keystrokes against a real spawned/waited process. |
| Syscalls (file I/O, spawn/wait, user-pointer validation) | ✅ Passes (manual) | Verified via temporary `user/init.c` scaffolds (reverted after each check): file round-trip through `sys_open`/`read`/`write`/`close`; a bad (kernel-address) pointer rejected by `access_ok` instead of dereferenced; spawn/wait observing a real child exit code; per-process fd isolation between two spawned processes. No dedicated automated selftest yet (only the scheduler-side effects are covered by `test sched *` above). |

## Next Steps

Dependency order — see `TODO.md`'s per-subsystem lists for the full detail
behind each item. Everything through Phase 22 (user-pointer validation,
the full scheduler + SMP + thread/process split + ring-3 threads, EMBKFS
v2's full feature set, **and** the newlib port, dynamic linking, the window
compositor, and the EmUI GUI stack — all of which landed *ahead of* the
self-hosting-first ordering originally sketched in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
is now done — **and so is self-hosting for C, now with real headers**: TCC
compiles, assembles, links and runs `#include`-using programs against the
on-image newlib headers and `libc.a` (`test tcc real` → `exit=42`, byte-exact
buffered-stdio output), and the OS has **rebuilt one of its own tools from
source** — `tally`, four translation units compiled on-OS, linked in a
separate invocation (the compile-then-link shape every build tool assumes),
installed, and A/B-verified against the host-built original through the
shell's live extern pipeline (`test tcc tally`). The OS also hosts
C++/libstdc++, CPython 3.14 and git 2.49; see [PORTS.md](PORTS.md).

**Honest scope of that claim:** the OS can compile, run, and now *rebuild its
own static C programs*. It cannot yet rebuild *itself* wholesale: that needs a
build orchestrator (decided: a native structured build tool — targets as typed
records, recipes as spawn argvs, staleness by content hash — with a make port
deferred to the future ports/compat story; see TODO.md), and the excluded
classes are TCC facts, stated plainly — no `__thread` (TCC reads no
`newlib.ld`/PT_TLS), no `libembk.so`-linked apps, no C++, and the kernel build
wants GCC (whose driver fork/execs `cc1`/`as`/`ld`, which this OS structurally
cannot do). "Self-hosting for C" remains the accurate phrase.

What's left:

1. ~~**embbuild**~~ — ✅ **the OS rebuilds the static-C core of its own
   userland, the shell included.** EmbBuild (BUILD.md) rebuilds tally,
   sysinfo, itself, and — the headline — **the shell**, whose TCC-built
   successor was staged, verified, and ADOPTED into the sealed `/system/bin`
   (snapshot → copy): pipelines that reach `/system/bin/shell.elf` now run
   through a shell the system built for itself (`test embbuild shell`).
   **Honest boundary, same shape as "self-hosting for C":** that C core is
   the shell plus the sval-family tools — *not* the GUI. So this is
   "rebuilds its own **static-C** userland."

   **Updated 2026-07-23 — the GUI came inside, and "static-C" can go.**
   This entry used to say TCC "cannot produce" `libembk.so` apps, which
   made "static-C userland" the honest ceiling. Both halves have now
   moved, in order, and the order is the point:

   1. **The capability.** `test tcc dyn` — tcc compiles an EmUI widget
      on-OS, dynamically links it against `libembk.so`, and the kernel
      loads and renders it (PORTS.md § "The GUI wall, and how it came
      down"). The blocker turned out to be a **kernel** bug of ours, not
      a tcc limit.
   2. **The rebuild claim.** A capability nothing exercises is not a
      rebuild claim, so this stayed pending a manifest.
      **`test embbuild gui`** supplies it: EmbBuild builds the clock
      widget from `/data/src/ui/build.ebm`, the staged ELF is `ET_EXEC
      phnum=5` (dynamic, not static), it renders, the rerun says `0 ran,
      3 up_to_date`, and the adopted `/data/apps/clockw/clockw.elf`
      runs.

   So the accurate sentence is now **"the OS rebuilds its own userland —
   the shell and the GUI included"**, and what remains is genuinely
   breadth: one widget has a manifest, the other EmUI apps do not.
   Still real limits, unchanged: `__thread`/TLS (no PT_TLS via the tcc
   link), C++, and the kernel (wants GCC — its driver fork/execs
   `cc1`/`as`/`ld`, which this OS structurally cannot do).
   The original entry, for the record:

   **embbuild** — the make-equivalent, the last named item between
   "self-hosting for C" and rebuild-self, and the one with a design doc:
   **[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)**. Its primitive is already proven end-to-end:
   `test tcc tally` compiles four translation units on-OS, links the
   tcc-produced objects in a separate invocation, installs the result, and
   A/B-runs it against the host-built original through the live shell
   pipeline. What remains is the orchestrator itself — a **native structured
   tool** (manifest of typed targets, recipes as spawn argvs, staleness by
   content hash, stage-then-adopt via atomic rename), with a make port
   deferred to the ports/compat story. v1 scope: rebuild tally + sysinfo
   from `/data/src`; second milestone `embbuild embbuild`.
2. ~~**A real TTY**~~ — **shipped**: the kernel console has a cooked/raw
   line discipline with blocking reads and routed ^C ([INTERRUPTION.md]
   (INTERRUPTION.md)), the shell does its own raw-mode line editing with
   history recall, and the Terminal app (`term.elf`) adds scrollback.
   Coreutils breadth remains open, but the structured shell's builtins +
   sval tools cover the daily set; new tools are one `/data/apps` directory
   each — and, since `test tcc tally`, can in principle be *built on the OS*.
3. **Per-CPU run queues** — the one piece of the SMP work deliberately left
   unbuilt: the single global `g_sched_lock` is the shipped design, and
   per-CPU queues are scoped as the *next* step only once that lock is
   *measured* to bottleneck (see the arch doc §8/§17), not built ahead of
   real need.
4. **Lazy PLT binding** for the dynamic linker — relocations are currently
   applied eagerly at load time (see Phase 22); fine at today's app count
   and sizes, worth revisiting if process start latency becomes a problem.
5. **True per-block snapshot refcounting / asymmetric verified-root
   signing** — both EMBKFS v2 known limitations (Phase 21), flagged
   in `docs/EMBKFS_spec_v2.2.md` as natural v2.x follow-ups, not attempted
   in this pass to keep the crypto/allocator surface reviewable.
